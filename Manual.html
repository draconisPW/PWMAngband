<img alt="" class="align-center" src="./lib/icons/mr-att.png" />
<p>PWMAngband is a complex multiplayer dungeon simulation. A player (you!)
creates a character, choosing from a variety of races and classes, and then
plays that character over a period of days, weeks, even months.</p>
<p>The player will begin their adventure on the town level where they may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by buying from various shop
owners. Then the player can descend into the Pits of Angband, where they will
explore the many levels of the dungeon, gaining experience by killing fierce
creatures, collecting powerful objects and valuable treasure, and returning to
town occasionally to buy supplies. Eventually, as the player grows more
experienced, they may attempt to win the game by defeating Morgoth, the Lord of
Darkness, who resides far below the surface.</p>
<p>PWMAngband is a very complex game, and it may be difficult to grasp everything
at first, especially if you have never played a roguelike game before. A key
resource for PWMAngband players is the forum, where you can ask for help, and
also post compliments, complaints, suggestions, bug reports, and interesting
experiences. Don't be shy!</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="a-quick-demonstration">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick demonstration</a></h2>
<p>PWMAngband is a very complex game, so you may want to try the following quick
demonstration. The following instructions are for demonstration purposes only,
and so they are intentionally boring.</p>
<p>For this demo, we will assume that you have never played PWMAngband before,
that you have not requested any special &quot;sub-windows&quot;, that you have not
requested any special &quot;graphics&quot; modes, that you have a &quot;numeric keypad&quot; on
your computer, and that you are using the default options, including, in
particular, the &quot;original&quot; command set. If any of these assumptions are
incorrect, you will need to keep in mind that this demo may not work; in
particular note that Windows users will be using graphical tiles by default,
so unless you turn off graphics map symbols below will be replaced by
little pictures. There are many ways to view this file while playing.</p>
<p>The first step is to select a server on which to play. If the metaserver is
up, a list of servers will automatically appear when the client is launched.
Choose a PWMAngband server (common servers are powerwyrm.publicvm.com,
wyrmband.ath.cx and pwmangband.seymourfamily.org). If the metaserver
is down, you may be asked to choose a server manually by entering its name.</p>
<p>When the game starts up, you will be asked to enter your account name. For
this demo, let's assume you don't have one, so enter an account name and a
password to protect your account, and then press 'a' to create a new
character.</p>
<p>During character creation, you will be shown the character information screen,
and you will be asked a series of questions. For this demo, enter a character
name (you can use the default name which is equal to the account's name), and
press 'a' three times to select a &quot;female human warrior&quot; character. Then press
'b' and 'Enter' to choose the standard roller, and choose stat order by pressing
'a', 'e', 'd', 'f', 'c', and 'b'. Press 'Enter' twice and your character will be
placed into the &quot;town&quot;.</p>
<p>You should now be looking at the basic dungeon interaction screen. To the
left is some information about your character. To the right is an overhead
view of the town. A lot of things happen in PWMAngband while the game is
waiting for you to specify a command, so stay safe in the Tavern and take
a good look at the town. You will see a variety of symbols on the screen. Each
symbol normally represents a terrain feature, an object, or a monster.
The '&#64;' symbol is special, it represents your character (or any other player
currently connected to the server). You can use the '/' command to find out
what type of monster a given symbol represents. Press '/' then 't' now
to verify the meaning of the 't' symbol.</p>
<p>The large rectangles represent stores and houses. The &quot;numeric&quot; symbols
represent an &quot;entrance&quot; to a store. The '.' symbols represent the &quot;floor&quot;.</p>
<p>Any &quot;alphabetic&quot; symbols always represent monsters, where the word
&quot;monsters&quot; specifies a wide variety of entities, including people, animals,
plants, etc. Only a few &quot;races&quot; of monsters normally appear in town, and
most of them are harmless (avoid any mercenaries or veterans if you see
them). The most common &quot;monsters&quot; in town are small animals (cats and dogs)
and townspeople (merchants, mercenaries, miscreants, etc).</p>
<p>Now use the 'l' command to &quot;look&quot; around. This will cause the cursor to
be moved onto each &quot;interesting&quot; square, one at a time, giving you a
description of that square. The cursor always starts on the square
containing your character.</p>
<p>Now press 'i', to display your character's &quot;inventory&quot;. New characters
start out with some objects to help them survive (though there is an option
to start with more money instead). Your character will have some food, a
potion, some torches, and a scroll. Press 'e' to see what you are
wearing. You will find you are wearing armour on your body, wielding a
dagger and lighting the way with a torch. You have many other
equipment slots but they are all currently empty.</p>
<p>Press 't' to take something off. Note that the equipment listing is
reduced to those objects which can actually be taken off. Press 'g' to
take off the armour, and then press 'e' again. Note that the armour is no
longer shown in the equipment. Press escape. Press 'w' to wield something
and observe that the inventory listing is reduced to those objects which
can actually be wielded or worn, press 'e' to put the armour back on.</p>
<p>So far, you have used the 'w' and 't' commands, which
take energy, and the 'e', 'i', 'l', and '/' commands, which are
&quot;free&quot; commands, and so do not take any energy. In general, the only
commands which take energy are the ones which require your character to
perform some action in the world of the game, such as moving around,
attacking monsters, and interacting with objects.</p>
<p>If there were any monsters near your character while you were experimenting
with the 'w' and 't' commands, you may have seen them &quot;move&quot; or even
&quot;attack&quot; your character. Although unlikely, it is even possible that your
character has already been killed. This is the only way to lose the game.
So if you have already lost, simply exit the game and restart this demo.</p>
<p>One of the most important things that your character can do is move around.
Use the numeric keys on the keypad to make your character move around. The
'4', '6', '8', and '2' keys move your character west, east, north,
and south, and the '7', '9', '1' and '3' keys move your character
diagonally. Explore the town and try to find the '&gt;' symbol. This is a
&quot;staircase&quot; - it is the entrance to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Attempting to stay away from monsters, try and move your character towards
the entrance to the &quot;general store&quot;, which is represented as a '1' on the
screen. As your character moves around, use the 'l' command to look
around. You can press escape at any time to cancel the looking. If you die,
start over.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things for people to get used to, when playing games of
this nature for the first time, is that the character is not the same as
the player. The player presses keys, and looks at a computer screen, while
the character performs complex actions, and interacts with a virtual world.
The player decides what the character should do, and tells her to do it,
and the character then performs the actions. These actions may induce some
changes in the virtual world. Some of these changes may be apparent to the
character, and information about the changes is then made available to the
player by a variety of methods, including messages, character state
changes, or visual changes to the screen. Some changes may only be apparent
to the player.</p>
<p>There are also a whole set of things that the player can do that can not
even be described in the virtual world inhabited by the character, such as
resize windows, read online help files, modify colormaps, or change
options. Some of these things may even affect the character in abstract
ways, for example, the player can request that from now on all monsters
know exactly where the character is at all times. Likewise, there are some
things that the character does on a regular basis that the player may not
even consider, such as digesting food, or searching for traps while walking
down a hallway.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, as you get used to the difference between the player
and the character, it becomes so &quot;obvious&quot; that you start to ignore it. At
that point, you find yourself merging the player and the character in your
mind, and you find yourself saying things like &quot;So yesterday, I was at my
friend's house, and I stayed up late playing PWMAngband, and I was attacked by
some wild dogs, and I got killed by a demon, but I made it to the high
score list&quot;, in which the pronoun changes back and forth from the real
world to the virtual one several times in the same sentence. So, from this
point on you may have to separate the player and the character for
yourself.</p>
<p>So anyway, keep walking towards the entrance to the general store until you
actually walk into it. At this point, the screen should change to the store
interaction screen. You will see the name of the shop-keeper, and the name
of the shop, and a list of objects which are available. If there are more
than twelve different objects, you can use the space or arrow keys to
scroll the list of objects. The general store is the only store with a fixed
inventory, although the amount of various items may vary. One of the items
sold here are flasks of oil. Press 'down' to highlight the line with
flasks of oil and press the 'p' key to purchase some. If you are asked
how many you want, just hit enter. Any time you are asked a question and
there is already something under the cursor, pressing return will accept
that choice. Hit enter to accept the price. Many commands work inside the
store, for example, use the 'i' command to see your inventory, with the
new flask of oil. Note that your inventory is always kept sorted in a
semi-logical order, so the indexes of some of the objects may change as
your inventory changes.</p>
<p>Purchase a few more flasks of oil, if possible: this time, when asked how
many you want, press '3' then return to buy three flasks at once. Flasks
of oil are very important for low level characters, because not only can
they be used to fuel a lantern (when you find one), but also they can be
ignited and thrown at monsters from a distance. So it is often a good idea
to have a few extra flasks of oil. Press escape to leave the store. If you
want, take time to visit the rest of the stores. One of the buildings,
marked with an '8', is the &quot;Tavern&quot;, and is not a real store. You can stay
safe in this building, people and monsters won't be able to attack you while
you're inside.</p>
<p>Now move to the staircase, represented by the '&gt;' symbol, and press
'&gt;', to go down the stairs. At this point, you are in the dungeon. Use
the 'l' command to look around. Note that you are standing on a staircase
leading back to town. Use the '&lt;' command to take the stairs back to
town. You may find that any townspeople that were here before have
disappeared and new ones have appeared instead. Now use the '&gt;' command
to go back down the stairs into the dungeon. You are now in a different
part of the dungeon than you were in before. The dungeon is so huge, once
you leave one part of the dungeon, you will never find it again.</p>
<p>Now look at the screen. Your character may be in a lit room, represented as a
large rectangle of illuminated floor grids ('.'), surrounded by walls. If
you are not in a lit room, keep going back up to the town and back down
into the dungeon until you are. Now look around. You may see some closed
doors ('+') or some open doors (''') or some open exits ('.') in the
walls which surround the room. If you do not, keep playing the stairway
game until you are in such a room. This will keep the demo simple.</p>
<p>Now look around using the 'l' command. You may see some monsters and/or
some objects in the room with you. You may see some stairs up ('&lt;') or
some stairs down ('&gt;'). If you see any monsters, move up next to the
monster, using the movement keys, and then try and move into the monster.
This will cause you to attack the monster. Keep moving into the monster
until you kill the monster, or it runs away, or you die. If you die, start
a new game. If the monster runs away, ignore it, or chase it, but do not
leave the room. Once all the monsters in the room are dead or gone, walk on
top of any objects in the room. Press 'g' to get the object, and it will
be added to your inventory. If there are any closed doors ('+') in the
room walk up next to them and press 'o' and then the direction key which
would move you into the door, which should attempt to &quot;open&quot; the door.</p>
<p>Now use the movement keys to explore the dungeon. As you leave the room,
you will probably notice that your character cannot see nearly as far as
she could in the room. Also, you will notice that as she moves around, the
screen keeps displaying some of the grids that your character has seen.
Think of this as a kind of &quot;map&quot; superimposed on the world itself, the
player can see the entire map, but the character can only see those parts
of the world which are actually nearby. If the character gets near the edge
of the &quot;map&quot; portion of the screen the entire map will scroll to show a new
portion of the world. Only about ten percent of the dungeon level can be
seen by the player at one time, but you can use the 'L' command to look
at other pieces of the map. Use the '.' key, then a direction, to &quot;run&quot;
through the dungeon. Use the 'R' key, then return, to force your
character to &quot;rest&quot; until she has recovered from any damage she incurs
while attacking monsters. Use the 'M' key to see the entire dungeon level
at once, and hit escape when done. If your food rations are still at index
'a' in your inventory, press 'E', 'a' to eat some food. If your oil
is still at index 'b' in your inventory, and there is a monster nearby,
press 'v', 'b', ''' to throw a flask of oil at the nearest monster.
To drop an item from your inventory, press 'd' plus the index of that
item. You can use the '^X' key to quit and save the game.</p>
<p>You now know enough to play a quick game of PWMAngband. There is a lot more
for you to learn, including how to interpret information about your
character, how to create different kinds of characters, how to determine
which equipment to wield/wear, how to use various kinds of objects, and how
to use the more than fifty different commands available to your character.
The best resource for learning these things is the online help, which
include, among other things, a complete list of all commands available to
you, and a list of all the symbols which you may encounter in the dungeon,
and information about creating new characters.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id22">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Players' Guide to PWMAngband</a></h2>
<p>This guide assumes familiarity with the basic mechanics of the game. If you're
completely new to PWMAngband, check out the user's manual and just start
playing, get into the dungeon and try, well, whatever seems to be prudent.
You'll probably die rather quickly, but the following will make much more sense
to you if you have just a little actual gameplay experience.</p>
<p>This guide was written for Angband 3.5.0, and is now a little out of date
(particularly the sections on identifying and collecting items). It is still
a handy source of hints and advice; just don't take it as an authority.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-basics">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basics</a></h3>
<p>As borrowed from a classic rgra post, there's not much that you actually have
to do. Your one and only mission is to slay Morgoth on dungeon level 100. In
order to get there, you need to go down a lot of stairs and kill Sauron on
dungeon level 99. That's about it - everything else is optional. Of course,
before you can kill Sauron you'll need lots of experience and good equipment,
but by the time you get that deep you'll have both. Just see to it that you
don't die along the way.</p>
<p>The one and most important thing you need to get in your head is that you can't
possibly kill every monster on every level. Think of the game as forays into
the dungeon from which you want to return with cool stuff; think of the
shallower levels as obstacles you need to overcome on your way deeper into the
dungeon; or whatever you like. Just never-ever think of it as a killing spree.
Until you find Sauron, your task is to survive and eventually get to level 99.</p>
<p>The next point is that you don't need to fight any particular monster (other
than the big two). Yes, there might be a rather impressive hoard in that
vault – but if the monsters guarding it are too many or too fierce, well, just
give it a pass. Angband offers an endless supply of monsters and treasure and
everything. There will always be another day – provided you live to see another
day. Sometimes you just have to bug out and run for your life.</p>
<p>So, let me recap, the vital points of Angband are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>go down a lot of stairs</li>
<li>kill Sauron (dl 99)</li>
<li>kill Morgoth (dl 100)</li>
<li>Quick start</li>
</ul>
<p>From this point, the guide assumes that you are playing a fighting class
(warrior, ranger, rogue or paladin) and race (Dunedain, High-Elf, Dwarf,
Half-Orc, Half-Troll.) First, use the 'cost-based' stats selection, and create
a character with 3 or 4 blows (Don't pick a class/race combinations, like Dwarf
Ranger, that can only get 2 blows.)</p>
<p>First, set your stats to get maximum blows. If you have a combination with good
dexterity, select 18/10 dexterity, and then set your strength to 17 or 18. Set
your spell-casting stat to something low but usable (~12), and spend the rest
on constitution. For a beginning character, constitution is least important,
because it doesn't add significant HP until well above 18.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24">1.2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Fighting Chance</a></h4>
<p>For a melee character, the most important measure of power is how much damage
they can do in a single turn. Consider the above cl 1 character with 3 blows
from a Rapier (+7,+9), in a fight vs an out-of-depth Bullroarer, with no
escapes, no ranged weapons, and no armor. On the face, she has no chance.
However, if she can get in the first blow, she in fact has a 71% chance of
killing Bullroarer in a single turn, and a 95% chance of frightening him.</p>
<p>Further, with full buffing (!Hero, ?Blessing ?Berserk Strength), the character
has an 81% chance of killing him in a single turn. As well as improving the
to-hit probability from 91% to 95%, this corresponds to a 50% reduction in the
chance of failure in a dangerous situation. Finally, assuming 'Anar' does win
this battle, she gets 450 experience, and immediately goes jumps to cl 8.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="missile-damage">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id25">1.2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missile Damage</a></h4>
<p>With proper preparation even a weak character has an almost guaranteed chance
of killing Bullroarer, if you meet him at a distance (across a lighted room).
An unenchanted longbow does 7.5 damage/shot with ordinary (unenchanted) arrows.
However, flasks of oil do 7HP nominal damage when thrown, and do triple damage
(21HP) vs fire-vulnerable monsters. Bullroarer has 60 HP, so even a small stack
of oil will finish him off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id26">1.2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Character power is more closely associated with damage output rather than
HP or character level.</li>
<li>If you preserve your supplies, you can fight well above your weight. Early
in the game, this means using flasks of oil against worthwhile targets;
later in the game this means using branded or slaying &quot;ego&quot; ammunition.
Good ammunition is too valuable to waste on less valuable targets (like red
jellies, or groups of orcs.)</li>
<li>Buffing, generally with !Heroism, can be very helpful to get starting
characters out of sticky situations.</li>
<li>Going deeper in the dungeon is often a more conservative (safer) strategy
than staying at a shallow (cl &lt; dl) depth. (cl: character level; dl: dungeon
level)  HP and character level are easy to come by.</li>

<div class="section" id="fighting-power">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id27">1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting Power</a></h3>
<p>Buy a light weapon that gives you the maximum possible blows, with the highest
dice available. This is generally a Rapier, Main Gauche, or Dagger. If these
are not available, you may be better off quitting and restarting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plan-to-be-deep">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id28">1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plan to be deep</a></h3>
<p>Always make sure to have a scroll of recall, even on your first trip into the
dungeon. Monsters and items at dl 5 (250') and deeper are much (~100x) more
valuable than items at dl 1. (The example above may be contrived, but it is
representative.)</p>
<p>To survive deep(er) you will want:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>Escapes:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>3+ ?Phase Door</li>
<li>1 ?Recall</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li>Protection from secondary effects (confusion, blindness, poison)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 !CLW (for identification and blindness)</li>
<li>1+ !CSW (for identification confusion)</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 !Hero (for protection from fear.)</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li>~5 Flasks of Oil to kill dangerous and/or valuable monsters (throw oil
for damage with the 'v' throw command)</li>
<li>~10-20 Iron shots (or arrows for Rangers) to throw at non-dangerous
monsters with annoying side effects. (Stat drainers and acid damagers
that are between you and the stairs down.) extra arrows for a ranger
(shoot arrows with the 'f' fire command.) Shots can be reused; oil can't.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="5">
<li>Armor</li>
</ol>
<p>Don't bother buying armor - it's very expensive in comparison to AC. You will
find it in the dungeon soon enough.</p>
<p>Your starting equipment will include more than enough food and illumination for
the first trip down.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-first-trip">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id29">1.2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first trip</a></h4>
<p>It's quite possible to get to 500' (dl 10) or deeper in the first trip into the
dungeon. Plan to return when either you have enough stuff that your character
will be significantly more powerful after reselling it, or if you run out of
either escapes (?Phase door), protection from side-effects (curing potions), or
damage (arrows if you are a ranger, flasks of oil if you are otherwise weak.)</p>
<p>Since you don't have much, don't spend it on less valuable monsters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-kill">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id30">1.2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to kill</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Any mobs of monsters that you can defeat (kill or frighten) in a single turn
and either give good experience (a pack of wolves) or good drops (weaker
orcs, novice humans.) If you are deep enough, this is likely to increase your
character by several levels in a single battle.</li>
<li>Uniques with good drops (Bullroarer, Brodda, Wormtongue)</li>
<li>Easy kills that are likely to drop something worthwhile.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-ignore">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id31">1.2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to ignore</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Monsters that will damage or destroy gear. (jellies, water hounds, etc)</li>
<li>Non-valuable monsters that are likely to use up consumables (baby bronze
dragons, groups of spell-casters in line-of-sight, etc)</li>
<li>Mobs that you can't dominate.</li>
<li>Uniques with escorts you can't dominate</li>
<li>Monsters at shallow depth. Drops for any given monster get better the deeper
you go. Killing a novice mage at dl 1 generally gives nothing; at dl 20 he's
likely to drop something worth hundreds of gold. Wormtongue has, on average, a
noticeably better drop at dl 20 than dl 10.</li>
<li>Things that waste effort. (Run-away breeders, low-EXP monsters with no drop.
Just close the door and move on.)</li>

<div class="section" id="on-bad-luck">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id33">1.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Bad Luck</a></h3>
<p>This is rule number one of Angband: don't take unnecessary risks. If you take
enough low-probability chances of death, you'll never survive to fight Sauron.
Such deaths are generally called 'stupid', but that's not always accurate.
Sometimes it's just bad luck. But given enough chances, you are guaranteed to
receive it. It's the trick to extremely fast dives: the fewer moves you make,
the less chance any one of them will be fatal, even if on average, your
individual moves are riskier than in slower play. But the strategy applies more
generally: unless you are exceedingly careful in play, messing around long
enough at any one depth guarantees that something bad will eventually happen.</p>

<div class="section" id="face-palm-tips">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id34">1.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face-palm Tips</a></h3>
<p>The preceding is good advice; however, it does not offer much more than
generalizations, albeit valid, for the &quot;intermediate&quot; (?) player. The
following is intended to state what many perceive to be blatantly obvious,
hence &quot;you did WHAT!&quot; face-palm deaths. This really should be cleaned up and
refactored, but placing here for now.</p>
<p>WARNING. I have yet to defeat Angband. This is a compilation of some of the
better tips I've learned while trying to explore the depths... (to Level ~35).
Additional advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<div class="section" id="start-simple">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id35">1.2.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start simple</a></h4>
<p>Begin your Angband career as a warrior. Warriors are relatively simple to
begin with, and are less likely to be eaten by a pack of jackals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="focus">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id36">1.2.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus!</a></h4>
<p>Angband is a very harsh game, in that the character you've been playing for
months could be killed by a single careless action. Playing when tired or
drunk is probably a good way to leave yourself with nothing but a sad tale to
share on the forums. If you have the ability to sense monsters or traps then
use it. This is particularly important when you begin to encounter monsters
that, without the appropriate gear, will kill your character in a single move.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-that-stuff">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id37">1.2.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use that stuff</a></h4>
<p>Angband has potions, spell books, wands, staffs, rods, activate-able items,
melee weapons, ranged weapons, and whatnot. They're meant to be used, for
crying out loud! It can take a while to get used to using all the different
types of items, but they work best when used in concert. For those able to use
magic devices, rods wands and staves can be very useful when your mana is
running low, and allow you access to spells that may not normally be available
to your class. They are also very useful for dealing with monsters that</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rangers-have-a-bow">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id38">1.2.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rangers have a bow</a></h4>
<p>Really a subset of the previous point, but it happens so often... Don't try to
play a ranger like a warrior -- rely on the bow! Similarly for mages, don't do
a Gandalf. He may be able to draw a sword and rush headlong in to a pack or
orcs, but mages in Angband are considerably more fragile. Priests are better
equipped to engage in melee combat - with their healing abilities compensating
for their somewhat fragile nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stockpile">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id39">1.2.5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockpile!</a></h4>
<p>Players may not be inclined to carry multiples of an item, or do so in a
limited quantity, perhaps due to weight encumbrance concerns. Don't be afraid
to carry a LOT of an item, particularly the basics -- food, light,
projectiles, cure potions, &quot;run away&quot; scrolls, etc. Don't be afraid to MAX OUT
important items! Some monsters will steal or destroy your items, so it's worth
carrying additional quantities of key items - such as Scrolls of Recall or
important spell/prayer books. This becomes very important when you reach
dungeon levels in which monsters develop fire and acid-based attacks. Mages
and priests tend to start out with low strength, and so are very limited in
how much stuff they can carry, so consider carrying additional copies of the
spellbooks that you know you can't afford to lose during a fight.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-item-you-don-t-use-is-useless">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id40">1.2.5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An item you don't use is useless</a></h4>
<p>Common fallacy: you find an incredibly powerful Staff of Mighty BOOM! (3
charges), or a single Potion of become Chuck Norris, and then you keep
carrying it around and never actually use it. It could be a life insurance,
but you might still reconsider your strategy: maybe you've become too careful
lately (Angband rewards deliberate risk-taking, after all). Or maybe you
should just sell the thing and invest the money into something you do use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="identifying-your-items">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id41">1.2.5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying your items</a></h4>
<p>Most items found will initially be unidentified. Characters able to pray or
cast spells will later develop the ability to identify items. Starting out, a
stack of Scrolls of Identify will allow these items to be identified. In the
early stages of the game these are expensive, so it may be more cost effective
to sell the items in the town until you can afford to regularly purchase
scrolls. Weapons and armour can be identified by being worn and used in combat,
and most can be removed if found to be of poor quality.</p>
<p>Staves, rods and wands can often be identified by being used against monsters,
but be aware that some of these magical items can have negative effects. Only
use this approach when facing easily defeated monsters. Consuming unidentified
potions and mushrooms is very risky, so it's best to either identify them
yourself or sell them in the town. Ammunition can normally be identified by
being thrown or fired at a monster, and typically the worst thing that can
happen is that the attack does little damage to the monster. As with staves,
wands and rods, do this when facing a monster than can be easily defeated.</p>
<p>Scrolls can normally be identified by being read, but some scrolls have
negative effects. Your character may have a very short life if they read a
scroll that summons a horde of undead monsters. If using this approach, it's a
good idea to position your character on top of some stairs so you can quickly
escape if a mysterious scroll leaves your character surrounded by monsters.</p>
<p>With weapons and armour, your character may in time be able to roughly gauge
the value of an item by keeping it in their bag while they explore the
dungeons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-dungeon-is-dark">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id42">1.2.5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dungeon is dark</a></h4>
<p>Players will readily note that corridors are unlit; however, what may not be
blatantly obvious is that the dungeon gets darker with depth, until it's pitch
black. ALWAYS carry a light source. DON'T drop a light source for more loot!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-can-run-away">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id43">1.2.5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can RUN AWAY</a></h4>
<p>There is NO RULE that you have to clean out a dungeon -- AT ALL. See something
you can't handle? Don't be afraid to leave -- NOW. Sure you could try to avoid
it, but then again, it could be a hummerhorn. Half way through the level? You
can still LEAVE NOW. Nearly finished with the level? You can still leave NOW.
Think of it as a tactical strike, not a genocide mission.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-away-now">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id44">1.2.5.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get away NOW!</a></h4>
<p>Sure, you should pay more attention and not get yourself in a next turn =
death situation, but this is not always avoidable and no one (presumably) is
so meticulously patient. ALWAYS carry get away items -- Phase Door, Teleport,
Recall, Teleport Level, etc. When you can, stockpile those that work NOW. If a
unique starts chasing you, you don't want to be waiting for Recall to kick in.</p>
<p>You should seriously consider a quick escape if dealing with a situation in
which monsters are breeding explosively. Some classes, such as mages, are more
easily able to handle these though the use of spells that affect multiple
monsters simultaneously, but even they should consider leaving if it becomes
apparent that the monsters are breeding more quickly than the player can kill
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-1-is-still-there">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id45">1.2.5.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 1 is still there</a></h4>
<p>Don't forget that you can always replay, and re-re-play the early levels for
ANY reason whatsoever. Recalled from a depth too deep? Dive from level 1 and
reset the depth. Want to fill your armor slots? Need a few more gold? Even if
you're on a streak diving through the dungeon, step back and reassess whether
you want to return to an earlier level -- you never know what could be lurking
around the corner.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="black-market-deals">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id46">1.2.5.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Black Market Deals</a></h4>
<p>Don't be afraid to buy from the &quot;blackmarket&quot;. Sure the prices are more
expensive than the other stores, but it tends to offer a good selection of
items and it can be worth the gold versus not having it in the dungeon. You
can always get more gold, but the RNG is random. It's just another store --
don't worry about the name. The blackmarket is often a good source of potions
to increase your stats, so it's worth checking it each time you visit the town
- and try to have enough gold to purchase potions for the most important stats
for your character.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="try-a-different-strategy">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id47">1.2.5.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try a Different Strategy</a></h4>
<p>Sure, what you're doing kinda works, but your characters keep dying off.
Playing conservatively? Try playing a character as though the &quot;iron-man&quot;
stairs setting is in effect. You'll probably want some ranged weapons for
this, but you may be surprised how fast you can level if you DIVE! Granted,
the lower levels are harder, but the deeper you go, the more experience per
kill you get. Still fight conservatively, but dive aggressively. Once your
character has gotten a decent complement of items and spells ... (what next?).
Don't be afraid to throw away characters -- DIVE aggressively until you get a
good feel for your character and you've leveled up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="on-depth-and-item-value">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id48">1.2.5.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Depth and Item Value</a></h4>
<p>Whenever you kill a monster that may drop an item, a lot of randomness is
played out. No need to go into detail just here (if you really want to know,
you can look it up in the spoilers), suffice it to say that depth is the
single most important factor. You may, of course, find rather valuable and/or
useful stuff even on the very first level, but the chances are rather small.</p>
<p>In short: if you want to find better things, you need to go deeper.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-monster-barely-matters">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id49">1.2.5.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monster barely matters</a></h4>
<p>If a monster drops an item, it can be anything. Really. You may find rare
spellbooks on illiterate Trolls, and jellies may drop artifact weapons. Some
rare monsters, like powerful dragons, will carry good or even exceptional
objects -- but still, the dungeon level is the most important factor. What was
&quot;exceptional&quot; on dl8 will probably be rather uninteresting on level 30.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="regarding-artifacts">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id50">1.2.5.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Artifacts</a></h4>
<p>For every single item, there is a 1 in 1000 chance that it will be an
artifact. This might seem slim, but considering the number of monsters you
will slay, it soon adds up. If you work through a large room full of orcs,
there's about a one-in-ten chance that you'll discover at least one artifact
among the carnage. Artifacts typically have impressive statistics and an
ability that can be activated.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id51">1.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surviving to clvl 31 / dlvl 36</a></h3>
<p>Additional tips learned from various failed attempts. Still have not beat
Angband, but making considerable progress of late, particularly with my (now)
current character.</p>
<div class="section" id="run-away">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id52">1.2.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RUN AWAY!</a></h4>
<p>Very first tip is a basic tenet repeated throughout the guide; however, it is
far too easy to become engrossed in your achievements (eg an awesome artifact,
maximizing stats, a slightly better item, gaining a second blow, getting a
speed bonus, etc) and lose it all due to something very avoidable had you been
paying diligent attention.</p>
<p>While playing, always make sure to check for the basics -- particularly
monsters, stairs, and traps. Don't loose a character, asserting that you can
kill a &quot;C&quot; easily only to discover that a &quot;Jackal&quot; is a far cry from a
&quot;Hellhound&quot;.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you just got some nice artifacts / other equipment or achieved a
significant accomplishment -- save your game and take a break. You don't have
to continue to play to enjoy your past success, and when you return you will
likely be more able to play diligently.</p>
<p>See a few uniques or other monsters that might possibly give you some trouble
-- maybe? Perhaps with only slight difficulty? See a vault with some cool
treasure, but a few troublesome monsters / uniques? If you're not highly
confident (perhaps even 100%) that you can easily survive the level, you can
leave on the spot. Just enter the level, immediately do your detection routine
(monsters, stairs / traps, etc) assess the immediate threat, and use the
stairs immediately if you want to. You can go up as readily as you came down,
and you can go down as readily as you came up. Further, artifacts can be
regenerated (unless you disabled that option) and as you dive, even better
items will be available. So, if you skip out on levels just because you want
to play it very conservatively, you will still find great items and better
yet, you have a higher chance of survival.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-awareness">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id53">1.2.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information Awareness</a></h4>
<p>Angband offers a LOT of information on a LOT of different screens. If you
haven't already, try enabling multiple consoles -- ALL of them -- and then try
out different options / combinations. Being able to view a lot of information
simultaneously at a glance is a considerable benefit over having to be
diligent enough to manually check each relevant screen each time.</p>
<p>Also, change the text size. Sure you may be accustomed to your terminal font
and size for reading; however, you can read and make sense from context a lot
easier than you can reliably identify the glyph, color, and relative position
of every character on the screen. Angband may be a text-based game, but you
don't have to play with a tiny (or even normal size font). Using a slightly
larger font makes identifying things a LOT easier. The SDL interface is
perhaps the easiest for using multiple terminals and changing fonts.</p>
<p>This alone has greatly contributed to my survivability!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-from-the-beginning">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id54">1.2.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start from the Beginning</a></h4>
<p>Trying to mature your character through the clvl / dlvl 20s can be challenging
until you can survive even lower depths. One tip here is to use Recall
exclusively to return from the dungeon and use the stairs to return back down
to the level you left.</p>
<p>Yes, this is more work, and as your clvl increases, the early levels become
exceptionally easy; however, it guarantees that you will always enter a level
on stairs, facilitating running away.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="item-collecting">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id55">1.2.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Item Collecting</a></h4>
<p>Its easy to stockpile, but you'll run out of space VERY quickly. Further, what
was useful may not be useful now and what's useful now may not be useful
later. It can be easy to try to grab everything in sight and then return to
town when your inventory is full to liquidate everything; however, when you
reach this point, try continuing to dive, even with a full inventory.</p>
<p>Inventory full of standard items and found a {magical} one? Toss a standard
one and pick it up. Got a lot of {magical} and found an {ego} item? Toss a
{magical} one. As your character progresses and you continue to dive you will
find better classes of items. If you can differentiate even by pseudo-ID,
don't be afraid to toss the less valuable stuff to make room, so you can
continue diving.</p>
<p>This is particularly important while diving. If you let a full inventory be a
limiting factor, you won't be able to get nearly as deep as if you are willing
to discard items along the way -- even if they would have fetched a decent
price. Remember, {magic} is usually worth still more than standard, and {ego}
is usually worth more than {magic}...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="take-a-break">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id56">1.2.6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take a Break</a></h4>
<p>Again, this is another basic tip repeated thorough out the guide; however,
learn to stop playing. You can always save your game and resume later when you
would be in your prime and optimally ready to play as opposed to trying to
continue to play as drowsiness sets in.</p>
<p>This may be difficult at first, but it can help you avoid running decent
characters into the ground for avoidable mistakes...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="don-t-forget-your-ranged-attacks">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id57">1.2.6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't forget your Ranged Attacks!</a></h4>
<p>Granted, as your character develops, you become more powerful at melee;
however, this does not preclude you from using ranged attacks! It is far to
easy to start playing a ranger like a warrior mage if you get a good melee
weapon, but don't forget your ranged skill! You may be &quot;Superb&quot; at Fighting,
but ranger's are even better at Shooting -- perhaps even &quot;Legendary&quot; or
better.</p>
<p>This can be a hard one to do diligently, especially if your melee weapon is
powerful, but try to play diligently and use ranged attacks. Try earlier
levels where survivability is much higher and try to play without melee
attacks for awhile to get used to using the bow again.</p>
<p>Even as your character matures, try to keep in mind your race / class core
strengths.</p>

<div class="section" id="part-i-the-basics">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id79">1.3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part I -- The Basics</a></h4>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What is MAngband?</li>
</ol>
<p>MAngband is a free online multiplayer real-time roguelike game, derived from
the single player game Angband.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>What are all the strange letters and symbols? (&#64;...t...*...)</li>
</ol>
<p>After creating a new character you will start in the tavern in town. The
white &#64; represents you, ... represents the floor/ground, * is a tree and # a
wall. The numbers (1-9) are stores, where you can buy new equipment and sell
stuff you've found in the dungeon. Monsters will (usually) be a colored
letter.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>What kind of equipment should I buy?</li>
</ol>
<p>You start with some items related to your class, like magic books if you're a
mage or a bow if you're a ranger. You should make sure you have at least the
following before entering the dungeon: a weapon, a light source and some food.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Ok - so what do I do now?</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the game is to kill Morgoth, Lord of Darkness. He lives 5000 feet
below the town so it's a pretty long walk. Luckily the dungeon is filled with
other monsters for you to kill on your way down.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>How do I get into the dungeon?</li>
</ol>
<p>Hit 'M' to see the map. The entrance to the dungeon is the down staircase
'&gt;'. Press '&gt;' when standing on it to enter. You can also use 'L' to look
around.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>What happens when I die?</li>
</ol>
<p>You become a ghost. If your ghost dies your character is gone and you must
start over from level 1. Ghosts can pass through walls and drift up to town
by hitting '&lt;'. Once you're back in town you can resurrect in the temple.
This will cost you half your experience points. If you don't want to
resurrect you can start over by hitting 'Q'. Ghosts also have certain undead
powers, accessible via the 'm' command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-ii-keymaps">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id80">1.3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part II -- Keymaps</a></h4>
<p>If you want to survive in MAngband, you will have to learn some basic keymaps.
This is because the game is in realtime and the adventurer will often find
himself in situations where he won't have time to enter all the commands
manually.</p>
<p>A keymap is a programmed key on your keyboard. You can program any key to do
whatever keypresses you'd like, in any order you'd like. Most people use the
function keys (F1-F12) for the keymaps because none of them are used for game
commands such as those mentioned in the beginning of this guide.</p>
<p>Example 1: You're a Mage. Gain the spell Detect Creatures. Hit 'G' then 'a'
then 'b'. Inscribe your Beginners magic book with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;m1">'&#64;m1</a>'. This gives your book
a specific number instead of just a position in your inventory. Positions may
change as you drop items or if an item is destroyed so if you don't give your
book a number the keymap might not find the right book. This is VERY important.</p>
<p>Push '%' to go to the keymap screen. Press d) Create a keymap. Push F1 on
your keyboard. Set the action as [Escape]m1b then hit '$'. Press 'y' to
save the keymap. You have now programmed the F1 key to execute the Detect
Creature spell.</p>
<p>Now, hit Esc to get out of the keymap menu. If you now try hitting F1 you will
cast the Detect Creature spell. But why the [Escape] part?  The [Escape] is the
same as escape. So if you were doing something else, like eating, quaffing, or
gaining spells, and something bad happens, you want the keymap to work!
Immediately.</p>
<p>Example 2: You're a Warrior. Inscribe your potion of Berserk Strength with
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;q1">'&#64;q1</a>'. Go to the keymap menu ('%') and choose option d) Create a keymap. Press
the key where you want this keymap, F2 for example. Set the action as
[Escape]q1 (see above). Then hit Esc, and you're in the game again.</p>
<p>When you now press F2 it will quaff your potion of Berserk Strength.</p>
<p>Example 3: You want to use a bow. Inscribe your arrows <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;f1">'&#64;f1</a>'. Set action as
[Escape]f1*t, and create the keymap. You can also set the action as [Escape]f1'
to target the closest monster, or even use the 'h' command to fire the default
ammo in your quiver at the closest monster.</p>
<p>Thats it! Check out the online documentation (<a class="reference external" href="http://mangband.org/help/">http://mangband.org/help/</a>) for
more info.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-character">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id82">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a Character</a></h2>
<p>PWMAngband is a roleplaying game, in which you, the player, control a
character in the world of Angband. Perhaps the most important thing you
control is the birth of your character, in which you choose or allow to be
chosen various attributes that will affect the future life of your
character.</p>
<p>Character creation, or birth, is controlled through a variety of choices
as to constraints on the type of character you wish to play, followed by
a series of random calculations to generate (&quot;roll up&quot;) a random character
matching the appropriate constraints.</p>
<p>The first step is to select a server on which to play. If the metaserver is
up, a list of servers will automatically appear when the client is launched.
Choose a PWMAngband server (common servers are powerwyrm.publicvm.com,
wyrmband.ath.cx and pwmangband.seymourfamily.org). If the metaserver
is down, you may be asked to choose a server manually by entering its name.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen a server, you will be asked to enter your account name.
Since your account will be saved on a distant server, you will also be asked
to provide a password to protect your account. Don't forget this password...
you will be asked to provide it again each time you want to access your account
and play with your characters! If you don't have an account on the server you
chose, one will be created for you with the password you provided. This
account will allow you to create characters and to maintain a list of all the
characters you created (so you don't accidentally forget the name of some of
your characters...)</p>
<p>Once you have access to the list of characters from your account, choose one
(or select &quot;New character&quot; to create a new one). The game will use the name
of the character you chose in the list as default value for your character
name (for new characters, the game will use the account name as default value).</p>
<p>Upon the death of your first character, you will be given the choice to
generate a new character obeying the same constraints: this is the quick-start
option, a way to generate characters quickly, especially useful for players who
tend to die a lot. Or you may want to start completely anew.</p>
<p>You may start the entire process over at any time.</p>

<div class="section" id="character-characteristics">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id83">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character Characteristics</a></h2>
<p>Each character has three primary attributes: sex, race, and class. These
are chosen at the beginning and which will stay fixed for the entire life
of that character. The sex of your character is purely for flavour, but the
race and class have many effects which are discussed in detail below.</p>
<p>Each character has a few secondary attributes: height, weight, and background
history. These are randomly determined according to the sex and race of
the character, and are only used to provide flavour to the character to
assist in role playing. There is an opportunity to edit background history
on the character screen.</p>
<p>Each character also has five primary &quot;stats&quot;: strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, and constitution; they modify the abilities
of the character in a variety of ways. Every stat has a numerical value,
ranging from a minimum of 3, up to a normal maximum of 18, and even higher,
into the &quot;percentile&quot; range, represented as '18/01' through '18/100':
this is the maximum that can be achieved intrinsically, for any given stat.
These stats can be modified further by equipment, race and class bonuses up
to a maximum of '18/220'.</p>
<p>Each character also has several primary &quot;skills&quot;: disarming, magic devices,
saving throws, stealth, searching ability, fighting skill, and shooting skill,
which are derived from the character's race, class, level, stats, and current
equipment. These skills have rather obvious effects, but will be described more
completely below.</p>
<p>Each character may have one or more &quot;racially intrinsic skills&quot;, based on
the race of the character. These may include special resistances, or
abilities such as infravision.</p>
<p>Each character has a number of &quot;experience points&quot;, which increases as the
character defeats monsters and attempts new spells and uses new items.
Characters also have a level, which is based on experience. The amount of
experience required to gain a new level is dependent on the character race.
Races with more intrinsic benefits require more experience to gain levels.
As the experience rises, so does the level, and as the level rises, certain
other abilities and characteristics rise as well. All characters start at
0 experience and at the first level.</p>
<p>Each character has some gold, which can be used to buy items from the shops
in the town, and which can be obtained not only from selling items to the
shops, but also by taking it from dead monsters and by finding it in the
dungeon. Each character starts out with some gold, the amount of which is
based on the character's social class (higher is better) and stats (less
powerful characters start with more gold). Each character also starts out
with a few useful items, which may be kept, or sold to a shop-keeper for
more gold. However, especially valuable items will never sell for the full
price, as each shopkeeper has a maximum that they are prepared to pay for any
item. The more generous shopkeepers may buy your items for up to 30,000
gold pieces: but some are really stingy, and will pay no more than 5,000.</p>
<p>Each character has an &quot;armour class&quot;, abbreviated to AC, representing how
well the character can avoid damage. The armour class is affected by
dexterity and equipment, so the concept includes both avoiding blows and
being able to take blows without being hurt. Armour class on equipment is
always denoted in square brackets, usually as a figure of '[X,+Y]' where
X is the intrinsic AC of the armour in question, and Y is the magical bonus
to armour class provided by that item.</p>
<p>Each character has &quot;hit points&quot;, or hp, representing how much damage the
character can sustain before they die. How many hit points a character has
is determined by race, class, level and constitution, as follows: each race
has a basic &quot;hit dice&quot; number - for instance, a Dwarf's basic hit die is
11, while a hobbit's is 7. This is modified by class: for instance, a
warrior gets a +10 bonus to the hit die, while a mage gets a +1 bonus and a
priest +2, so a dwarven warrior's total hit die will be (11+10)=21 - meaning
that they get between 1 and 21 hit points per level. If they were a priest,
his hit dice would be (11+2)=13, and get between 1 and 13 hit points per
level. The hobbit mage would get only 1-8 hps per level. (All characters
get the maximum at first level: thereafter it is a random roll of 1dX where
X is the hit die number, when the character goes up in level.) This is
further modified by constitution - a character with high constitution will
get a flat bonus of a certain number of hit points per level (recalculated
right back to level 1: if you gain an extra hit point per level, and you
are 42nd level, you will suddenly be 42 hit points better off.)</p>
<p>Each character has spell points, or mana, which limits how many spells (or
prayers) a character can cast (or pray). The maximum number of spell points
is derived from your class, level, and intelligence (for spells) or wisdom
(for prayers), and you can never have more spell points than the maximum.
Spell points may be regained by resting, or by magical means. Warriors
never have any spell points. If a character gains enough wisdom or
intelligence to get more spell points, the result is calculated right back
to first level, just as with constitution and hit points.</p>
<p>Lastly, each character has a base speed. Speed determines the amount of
&quot;energy&quot; your character acquires in the game, and therefore how often you
can take actions which use up energy (like moving or attacking). All
beginning characters move at normal speed and the only way to increase
speed is by magical means and equipment bonuses. Characters who are
carrying too much weight will move more slowly. Extra speed is one of the
most important boons in the game and therefore one of the rarest and most
sought after.</p>
<div class="section" id="races">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id84">2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Races</a></h3>
<p>There are fifteen different races that you can choose to play in PWMAngband.
Each race has its own adjustments to a character's stats and abilities.
Most races also have intrinsic abilities. The bonuses to statistics and
the experience penalty will be displayed next to the races as you move
to select one.</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="human">
<dt>Human</dt>
<dd>The human is the base character. All other races are compared to them.
Humans are average at everything and tend to go up levels faster than any
other race due to their shorter life spans. No racial adjustments or
intrinsics occur to human characters. Humans do not have any infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="half-elf">
<dt>Half-Elf</dt>
<dd>Half-elves tend to be smarter and faster than a human, but not as wise or
strong. Half-elves are slightly better at magic, disarming, saving
throws, stealth and archery, but they are not as good at hand-to-hand combat.
Half-elves are immune to dexterity draining, and have weak infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="elf">
<dt>Elf</dt>
<dd>Elves are better magicians than humans, but not as good at fighting. They
tend to be smarter and faster than humans, though not as wise or strong.
Elves are better at disarming, stealth, archery and magic, but they are not
as good at hand-to-hand combat. They are resistant to attacks involving
bright light, are immune to dexterity draining, and have fair infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="hobbit">
<dt>Hobbit</dt>
<dd>Hobbits, or Halflings, are very good at shooting, throwing, and have good
saving throws. They also are very good at disarming and stealth; so they make
excellent rogues, but prefer to be called burglars. They will be much weaker
than humans, and not good at melee fighting. Halflings have fair infravision.
They have a strong hold on their life force, and are thus resistant to life
draining. Hobbits are very partial to mushrooms and can identify them when
found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="gnome">
<dt>Gnome</dt>
<dd>Gnomes are smaller than dwarves but larger than halflings. They, like the
halflings, live in the earth in burrow-like homes. Gnomes make excellent
mages, and have very good saving throws. They are good at disarming and
stealth. They have lower strength than humans so they are not very good at
fighting with hand weapons. Gnomes have good infravision. Gnomes are
intrinsically protected against paralysis and some slowing effects. Gnomes
are excellent at using wands and staves and can identify them when found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="dwarf">
<dt>Dwarf</dt>
<dd>Dwarves are the headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Since dungeons
are the natural home of a dwarf, they are excellent choices for a warrior
or priest - or indeed, that combination of the two, the paladin. Dwarves
tend to be stronger and tougher but slower and less intelligent than
humans. Because they are so headstrong and are somewhat wise, they resist
spells which are cast on them. Dwarves also have excellent infravision.
They can never be blinded. Dwarves are excellent at digging, and can
sense nearby buried treasure. They have one big drawback, though. Dwarves
are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with
themselves for no good reason, screaming out challenges at imagined foes.
In other words, dwarves have a miserable stealth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="half-orc">
<dt>Half-Orc</dt>
<dd>Half-Orcs make excellent warriors and decent priests, but are terrible at
magic. They are as bad as dwarves at stealth, and horrible at disarming.
Half-Orcs are, let's face it, ugly. They tend to pay more for goods in town.
Half-Orcs do make good warriors and rogues, for the simple reason that
Half-Orcs tend to have great constitution and lots of hit points. Because of
their preference to living underground to on the surface, half-orcs resist
darkness attacks. They have fair infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="half-troll">
<dt>Half-Troll</dt>
<dd>Half-Trolls are incredibly strong, and have more hit points than most
other character race. They are also very stupid and slow. They will make
great warriors and iffy priests. They are bad at disarming and stealth. They
are so ugly that a Half-Orc grimaces in their presence. Half-trolls always
have their strength sustained, and they regenerate quickly like other trolls.
Unfortunately, this regeneration also requires them to eat more food than
other races. They have fair infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="dunadan">
<dt>Dunadan</dt>
<dd>Dunedain are a race of hardy men from the West. This elder race surpasses
human abilities in every field, especially constitution. However, being
men of the world, very little is new to them, and levels are very hard to
gain... their hardiness ensures that their constitution cannot be
reduced. They have no infravision.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="high-elf">
<dt>High-Elf</dt>
<dd>High-Elves are descended from those among the Elves who heard and
answered the call from the Valar at the very beginning of time, before
the sun and moon were made, and lived in the Blessed Realm for many
thousands of years before returning to mortal lands. Because of this,
they are far superior in terms of abilities when compared to their lesser
Elven kindred. They can also see into the invisible world of ghosts and
wraiths. However, they find new experience even harder to come by than
Dunedain. Like normal Elves, they resist attacks involving bright light.
They have good infravision and can even see cold-blooded invisible
creatures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="kobold">
<dt>Kobold</dt>
<dd>Kobolds are a race of small dog-headed humanoids that dwell underground.
They have excellent infravision, and are intrinsically resistant to
poisons of all kinds. They have a good dexterity and constitution.
However, they are weaker than humans, and also not noted for great
intelligence. Furthermore, they are ugly, and not trusted in town. And
while their constitution makes them tough, it still cannot prevent the
fact that they are not the biggest of creatures, and have few hit points.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="yeek">
<dt>Yeek</dt>
<dd>Yeeks are a race of small furry humanoids. They are very light, therefore
they can fall like a feather. Also known as Weaklings, they have the lowest
stats and hit points available to a race. Yeeks are average at everything
and tend to go up levels much faster than any other race because of their
very short life spans. No racial adjustments to skills occur to characters
choosing yeek.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="ent">
<dt>Ent</dt>
<dd>The Ents are a powerful race dating from the beginning of the world, eldest
of all animals or plants who inhabit Arda. Spirits of the land, they were
summoned to guard the forests of Middle-earth. Being much like trees they are
very slow but strong and do not have to eat as often. As the Shepherds of the
Trees, they can learn to sense the presence of others, such as animals at
level 10, orcs at 15, trolls at 20, giants at 25, dragons at 30, demons at
35, undead at 40, all evil-minded creatures at 45, and even every minded
creatures in a short range at level 50. At level 5 they learn to see
invisible things. They accumulate experience very slowly. They make great
fighters, priests and paladins. Unfortunately, as they're made almost
exclusively of wood, they're also vulnerable to fire.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="thunderlord">
<dt>Thunderlord</dt>
<dd>Thunderlords are an old and powerful race of dragon hunters. They have an
intrinsic telepathic vision of all nearby creatures, the radius expands as
they gain levels. At level 5, they can spot dragons anywhere on a level. They
even gain intrinsic basic resistances, fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20
and lightning at 25. Thunderlords have tamed the Great Eagles of Middle-Earth
and use them in their hunts. They need a very long time to gain experience,
as both bird and man need to gain levels. They need to eat often.
Thunderlords can fall like a feather from birth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="dragon">
<dt>Dragon</dt>
<dd>They are creatures legends are made of. Dragons have a great health, but need
much more experience to advance in levels compared to humans. They have a bad
stealth. They can fall like a feather and resist nexus intrinsically. The
Dragon race is a very special race. Dragons evolve physically as they gain
experience. At level 1, they start as newborn dragons. At level 5, the color
of their scales is revealed and they polymorph into a baby dragon of that
color. At level 15, they polymorph into a young dragon. At level 25, they
polymorph into a fully grown dragon. At level 35, they become an ancient
dragon. At level 45, they polymorph into a mighty wyrm. Finally, at level 50,
they become an ancient wyrm. Dragons cannot wield any weapons; they get
special melee attacks instead (biting and clawing) that increase in power as
they gain levels. Starting at level 5, Dragons are able to breathe their
corresponding element, but using this ability costs them hit points. At that
level, they also gain the innate resistances and abilities of their type.</dd>

<div class="section" id="classes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id85">2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classes</a></h3>
<p>Once a race has been chosen, you will need to pick a class. The class
is the character's occupation and determines stat bonuses, abilities,
hit dice, and what spells (if any) the character can learn.</p>
<dl class="docutils" id="warrior">
<dt>Warrior</dt>
<dd>A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most of his problems
by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
a magical device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and
dexterity, and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
other class. A Warrior will be excellent at fighting, shooting and
throwing, but bad at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
cannot learn any spells.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="mage">
<dt>Mage</dt>
<dd>A Mage must live by his wits. They cannot hope to simply hack his way
through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. They can
master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
has the excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at him.
However, they are incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is their primary stat
and at high levels they can cast many spells without a chance of failure.
There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
are their true realm and they will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
other classes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="druid">
<dt>Druid</dt>
<dd>A Druid is a lover of nature, and at one with the natural world. Druids
have control of their environment and direct power over creatures, leading
even to the ability to take their forms. Druid skills are moderate, and
they have some fighting ability, especially when transformed. A druid will
usually seek to shape the flow of events to their purpose rather than
using devices or missiles, but at high levels they do gain access to
potent nature-based magic. Druids rely on their wisdom, and have good
saving throws.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="priest">
<dt>Priest</dt>
<dd>A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
which spells they will learn. They are familiar with magical devices,
preferring to call them &quot;instruments of God&quot;, but are not as good as a
mage in their use. Priests have great saving throws, and make passable
fighters, better if they can find a blessed weapon. Wisdom is the priest's
primary stat and at high enough levels they can cast many prayers without
a chance of failure. Priests have poor stealth.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="necromancer">
<dt>Necromancer</dt>
<dd>A Necromancer seeks to master the spirits of sentient creatures, creating
servants of their own will. They have chosen a dark and wicked path, and
run a continual risk of harm to their own body and mind. Necromancers love
shadows and hate light, automatically shrouding themselves in darkness.
Their spells require high intelligence, and frequently harm the caster or
place them in danger. In return they achieve awesome power at high levels.
The ultimate aim of the necromancer is to supplant the Dark Enemy and set
up a tyranny in his place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="paladin">
<dt>Paladin</dt>
<dd>A Paladin is a warrior/priest. Paladins are very good fighters, second
only to the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons. They
receive prayers at a slower pace than the priest, but can use all but the
most powerful prayers. A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities.
Paladins have poor stealth, perception, searching, and magical device use.
They have a decent saving throw due to their divine alliance. Their
primary stats are strength and wisdom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="rogue">
<dt>Rogue</dt>
<dd>A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by their cunning, but is
capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and
locks, to the experienced rogue no device is impossible to overcome. A rogue
has a high stealth enabling sneaking around many creatures without
having to fight, or sneaking up and get the first blow. They can steal items
from monsters, but need to be wary of being caught in the act. Rogues'
perception is higher than any other class, and many times they will notice
a trap or secret door before having to search. A rogue is better than
the more fighting oriented classes with magical devices, but still cannot
rely on their performance. Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the
powerful offensive spells mages can use, and there will always be a chance
of failure even with the simplest spells. A rogue's primary stats are
dexterity and intelligence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="ranger">
<dt>Ranger</dt>
<dd>A Ranger is at home in nature, and good at turning the environment to
good use. Rangers are good fighters, and one of the best of all the classes
with missile weapons, especially bows. The ranger learns chiefly spells of
survival and forest craft. A ranger has good stealth, good perception,
good searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
Their primary stats are strength, wisdom and dexterity.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="blackguard">
<dt>Blackguard</dt>
<dd>A Blackguard is a brawler of no principle, who lives for the joy of maiming
and killing. Blackguards prefer heavy weapons and shields, and learn a few
spells for the purpose of wreaking more destruction. Their lust for blood
is legendary, with a blackguard in full cry nigh on impossible to kill.
Blackguards scorn skills apart from slaughter, and require strength and
intelligence (or rat-cunning) to thrive in the dungeon.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="sorceror">
<dt>Sorceror</dt>
<dd>Sorcerors use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have to
cast spells and how low their failure rate is. They are the all-around best
magicians, having the most powerful spells. A high-level Sorceror can be very
powerful, but getting there can be a difficult journey. On the downside, they
are the worst fighters, being unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff
comfortably, and still unable to be anything even remotely approaching
effective with it. A Sorceror has very few hit points compared to other
classes, making survival difficult in the beginning. That's why this class is
not recommended for beginners. Intelligence is the sorceror's primary stat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="unbeliever">
<dt>Unbeliever</dt>
<dd>The full opposite of Sorcerors, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in the
use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally incompetent when trying
to use a magic item, although they can still quaff potions and read scrolls.
Because they are so unattuned to magic, Unbelievers can prevent magical gates
from opening around them, eventually extending to a complete suppression of
teleportation abilities and all magic in the area around them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="archer">
<dt>Archer</dt>
<dd>Archers aren't good at fighting, but can deliever extremely high damage with
their ranged weapons. They can die quickly too, however. Archers are to bows
what warriors are to melee. They are the best class around with any
bow/xbow/sling. An Archer is very bad at melee, being only better than the
Sorceror. Wisdom and Dexterity are the archer's primary stats.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="monk">
<dt>Monk</dt>
<dd>Monks are warriors who decide to fight barehanded. As they advance in levels,
they gain some new martial arts techniques to hit their opponents more
effectively. With levels, they also gain interesting abilities: at level 10,
they learn to fall like a feather; at level 15, they become resistant to
fear; at level 20, they become resistant to confusion; finally, at level 25,
they learn to resist paralysis effects. They can't wield weapons, but get
extra damage, defense and attacks per round as they advance in levels.
However, they must wear light armor to stay unencumbered and fully benefit
from their class bonuses.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="telepath">
<dt>Telepath</dt>
<dd>Telepaths are mindcrafters who use the powers of their mind to weaken or even
kill creatures. They are weak in melee, although they can use weapons just
like mages or priests. Wisdom is their primary stat.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="elementalist">
<dt>Elementalist</dt>
<dd>Elementalists are spellcasters specialized in offensive spells. They share
the same stats as mages, but get almost no support spells at all. They rely
on the powers of the four elements (Air, Fire, Earth, Water) and can combine
them to cast powerful Elemental spells. Elementalists have the innate ability
to increase the power of their spells by studying them again each time they
level. As masters of the elements, they gain intrinsic basic resistances as
they level, fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20 and lightning at 25.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="summoner">
<dt>Summoner</dt>
<dd>A Summoner is the weakest of all classes you may choose. They have pathetic
stats, no fighting abilities, and little spells to kill enemies with magic.
However, all these weaknesses don't trouble them much, because they can
summon creatures to help them in battle, and still gain some experience from
their kills. Summoners use wisdom to cast spells and summon allies, and to
determine how many of them they can control and how effectively they can
control them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="docutils" id="shapechanger">
<dt>Shapechanger</dt>
<dd>Shapechangers are fighters that get abilities from the forms they can mimic.
Basically, Shapechangers will melee a lot with the benefits from their
current form (resists, melee brands, defense, speed and damage boosts...).
Some of those forms will provide innate spells and even breath attacks.
Shapechangers get basic mana points to cast those spells (note that breath
attacks, like for the Dragon race, don't cost mana, but hit points
instead...).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stats">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id86">2.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stats</a></h3>
<p>After gender, race and class are selected, you will be able to decide
what stat levels your character will have, by allocating a finite number
of &quot;points&quot; between the five statistics. These points can be allocated
by selection or with a random roller (as described below in the &quot;Stat
Rollers&quot; section). Each race/class combination also has a recommended
default setting for these statistics. Statistics can be permanently
raised by various potions in the dungeon up to 18/100. They can also be
temporarily drained by some monster attacks.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Strength</dt>
<dd>Strength is important in fighting with weapons and in melee combat. A
high strength can improve your chances of hitting as well as the amount
of damage done with each hit. Characters with low strength may receive
penalties. Strength raises the amount of weight you can carry before
being slowed. It also allows you to get extra blows with heavier weapons.
Strength is one of the most important stats in the beginning of the game.</dd>
<dt>Intelligence</dt>
<dd>Intelligence affects the spellcasting abilities of mage-like spellcasters:
mages, rangers, and rogues. Intelligence will affect the number of spells
you may learn each level as well as the number of spell points you
receive. Intelligence is the most important stat for mages. A high
intelligence may also improve your chances of successfully casting a
spell. You cannot learn spells if your intelligence is 7 or lower. A good
intelligence can also help with using magic devices, picking locks, and
disarming traps.</dd>
<dt>Wisdom</dt>
<dd>The primary function of wisdom is to determine the ability of a priest or
paladin to use prayers, just like intelligence affects spellcasting.
Again, high wisdom will increase the number of mana points you have and
increase the number of prayers you can learn each level, while improving
the chance that a prayer will be successful. A good wisdom increases your
saving throw, thereby improving your chances of resisting magical spells
cast upon you by monsters.</dd>
<dt>Dexterity</dt>
<dd>Dexterity is a combination of agility and quickness. A high dexterity may
allow a character to get multiple blows with lighter weapons. Dexterity
also increases a character's chances of hitting with any weapon and of
dodging blows from enemies. Dexterity is also useful in picking locks,
disarming traps, and protecting yourself from some of the thieves that
inhabit the dungeons. Indeed, if the character has a high enough
dexterity, thieves will never be successful in stealing from him.</dd>
<dt>Constitution</dt>
<dd>Constitution is a character's ability to resist damage to his body, and
to recover from damage received. Therefore a character with a high
constitution will receive more hit points and also recover them faster
while resting. Constitution is less important in the beginning of the
game, but will be the most important stat at the end.</dd>

<div class="section" id="skills">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id87">2.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skills</a></h3>
<p>Characters possess some different skills which can help them to survive.
The starting skill levels of a character are based upon race and class.
Skill levels may be adjusted by high or low stats, and may increase with
the level of the character.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Infravision</dt>
<dd>Infravision is the ability to see heat sources. Since most of the dungeon
is cool or cold, infravision will not allow the player to see walls and
objects. Infravision will allow a character to see any warm-blooded
creatures up to a certain distance. This ability works equally well with
or without a light source. However, some of PWMAngband's creatures are
cold-blooded, and will not be detected unless lit up by a light source.
All non-human races have innate infravision. Humans (including Dunedain)
cannot gain infravision unless it is magically enhanced. Infravision does
not increase with character level, and is purely dependent on race and on
magical equipment.</dd>
<dt>Fighting</dt>
<dd>Fighting is the ability to hit and do damage with weapons or fists.
Normally a character gets a single blow from any weapon, but with
high enough dexterity and strength may receive more blows with
lighter weapons. Strength and dexterity both modify the ability to hit an
opponent. This skill increases with the level of the character. Inspecting
a weapon will show you how quickly you can attack with it.</dd>
<dt>Shooting Ability</dt>
<dd>Using ranged missile weapons (and throwing objects) is included in this
skill. Different stats apply to different weapons, but this ability may
modify the distance an object is thrown/fired, the amount of damage done,
and the ability to hit a creature. This skill increases with the level of
the character.</dd>
<dt>Saving Throws</dt>
<dd>A Saving Throw is the ability of a character to resist the effects of a
spell cast on him by another person/creature. This does not include
spells cast on the player by his own stupidity, such as quaffing a nasty
potion. This ability increases with the level of the character, but then
most high level creatures are better at casting spells, so it tends to
even out. A high wisdom also increases this ability. It is possible to
get 100% saving throw, making you immune to many attacks.</dd>
<dt>Stealth</dt>
<dd>The ability to move silently about is very useful. Characters with good
stealth can usually surprise their opponents, gaining the first blow.
Also, creatures may fail to notice a stealthy character entirely,
allowing a player to avoid certain fights. This skill is based upon race
and class, but can be magically enhanced.</dd>
<dt>Disarming</dt>
<dd>Disarming is the ability to remove traps safely, and also includes
picking locks on traps and doors. A successful disarming will gain the
character a small amount of experience. A trap must be found before it
can be disarmed. Traps are either physical or magical devices, so the
character has two disarming skills. Dexterity modifies disarming of
physical traps, and intelligence modifies disarming of magical traps.
Both these abilities increase with the level of the character.</dd>
<dt>Magical Devices</dt>
<dd>Using a magical device such as a wand or staff requires experience and
knowledge. Spell users such as mages and priests are therefore much
better at using a magical device than say a warrior. This skill is
modified by intelligence, and increases with the level of the character.</dd>
<dt>Searching (Perception)</dt>
<dd>Perception is the ability to notice traps without actively seeking them
out. Rogues are the best at searching, but rangers are also good at it.
This skill is based on race and class, and increases with character level.</dd>

<p>For character classes, there are two figures: the first figure is the base
level of the skill, while the second figure (in parentheses) is the bonus
that the character gains to this skill every ten levels. So, to find out
the total skill value of any character's skills, add the race value to the
class value, and then the bonus once for every ten levels that the
character has.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that these numbers are only good for comparing
characters to each other in the absence of other bonuses from high stats
(strength bonus to-dam, dex bonus to-hit, wisdom bonus to saving throw,
intelligence bonus to magical device usage, etc.) or wearing magical items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stat-rollers">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id90">2.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stat rollers</a></h3>
<p>There are currently two different ways to determine the starting stats of
your character - you can choose which one to use from the birth screen.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Point-based</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The point-based method allows you to &quot;buy&quot; improvements to your basic
stats by &quot;spending&quot; points on them. You have a fixed number of points to
spend, and making small changes to a stat costs proportionally less than
making large changes.</p>
<p class="last">This is the recommended birth method.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Standard roller</dt>
<dd>The standard roller is the traditional PWMAngband method of determining the
starting stats for a character. It allows you to specify the order in which
your stats will be rolled (from highest to lowest), and then repeated &quot;rolls&quot;
random characters using PWMAngband's traditional stat-rolling system until
minimum values of 17 for the first stat, 15 for the second stat and 12 for
the third stat have been rolled.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="character-name">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id91">2.2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Character Name</a></h3>
<p>In general, the actual choice of a name is not important, but do
keep in mind that it may have some effect on the game itself. For example,
on some machines, the character name determines the filename that will be
used to save the character to disk. The character name is used on the high
score list.</p>
<p>You can play a dynasty of characters. If you use a Roman numeral at the end
of your character name (like &quot;Fred I&quot; or &quot;Pimplesnarg XVI&quot;), the game will
automatically increment the numeral each time you die.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exploring-the-dungeon">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id92">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring the Dungeon</a></h2>
<p>After you have created your character, you will begin your PWMAngband
adventure. Symbols appearing on your screen will represent the dungeon's
walls, floor, objects, features, and creatures lurking about. In order to
direct your character through their adventure, you will enter single
character commands (see 'commands.txt').</p>
<div class="section" id="symbols-on-your-map">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id93">2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symbols On Your Map</a></h3>
<p>Symbols on your map can be broken down into three categories: features of
the dungeon such as walls, floor, doors, and traps; objects which can be
picked up such as treasure, weapons, magical devices, etc; and creatures
which may or may not move about the dungeon, but are mostly harmful to your
character's well being.</p>
<p>Some symbols are used to represent more than one type of entity, and some

<div class="section" id="the-town-level">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id98">2.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Town Level</a></h3>
<p>The town level is where you will begin your adventure. The town consists of
ten buildings (each with an entrance), some townspeople, some houses that can
be bought to store treasures and sell items to other players, and (sometimes)
a wall which surrounds the town. The first time you are in town it will be
daytime (or night time), but note that the sun rises and falls (rather
instantly) as time passes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="townspeople">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id99">2.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Townspeople</a></h3>
<p>The town contains many different kinds of people. There are the street
urchins, young children who will mob an adventurer for money, and seem to
come out of the woodwork when excited. Blubbering idiots are a constant
annoyance, but not harmful. Public drunks wander about the town singing,
and are of no threat to anyone. Sneaky rogues hang about watching for a
likely victim to mug. And finally, no town would be complete without a swarm
of half drunk warriors, who take offense or become annoyed just for the fun
of it. (There are assumed to be other people in the town, but they are not
represented on the screen as they do not interact with the player in any
way.)</p>
<p>Most of the townspeople should be avoided by the largest possible distance
when you wander from store to store. Fights will break out, though, so be
prepared. Since your character grew up in this world of intrigue, no
experience is awarded for killing the town inhabitants, though you may
acquire treasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="town-buildings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id100">2.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Town Buildings</a></h3>
<p>Your character will begin their adventure with some basic supplies, and some
extra gold with which to purchase more supplies at the town stores.</p>
<p>You may enter any open store to buy items of the appropriate type.
The price that the shopkeeper requests is dependent on the price of the item.
By default stores will not buy items from the player. If you choose to play
with selling enabled, stores have a maximum value; they will not pay more
than that for any item, regardless of how much it is actually worth.</p>
<p>Once inside a store, you will see the name and race of the store owner, the
name of the store, the maximum amount of cash that the store owner will pay
for any one item, and the store inventory, listed along with the prices.</p>
<p>You will also see an (incomplete) list of available commands. Note that
some of the commands which work in the dungeon work in the stores as well,
but some do not, especially those which involve &quot;using&quot; objects.</p>
<p>Stores do not always have everything in stock. As the game progresses, they
may get new items so check from time to time. Also, if you sell them an item,
it may get sold to a customer while you are adventuring, so don't always expect
to be able to get back everything you have sold. If you have a lot of spare
gold, you can purchase every item in a store, which will induce the store owner
to bring out new stock, and perhaps even retire.</p>
<p>Store owners will not accept known harmful or useless items. If an object is
unidentified, they will (if selling is enabled) pay you some base price for
it. Once they have bought it they will immediately identify the object.
If it is a good object, they will add it to their inventory. If it was a bad
bargain, they simply throw the item away. You can use this feature to learn
item flavors.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The General Store ('1')</dt>
<dd>The General Store sells foods, some clothing, torches, oil, shovels, picks
and basic ammo for launchers. All of these items and some others can be sold
back to the general store for money. The general store restocks like every
store, but the inventory types never change.</dd>
<dt>The Armoury ('2')</dt>
<dd>The Armoury is where the town's armour is fashioned. All sorts of
protective gear may be bought and sold here. The deeper into the dungeon
you progress the more exotic the equipment you will find stocked in the
armoury. However, some armour types will never appear here unless you
sell them.</dd>
<dt>The Weaponsmith's Shop ('3')</dt>
<dd>The Weaponsmith's Shop is where the town's weapons are fashioned. Hand
and missile weapons may be purchased and sold here, along with arrows,
bolts, and shots. As with the armoury, not all weapon types will be
stocked here, unless they are sold to the shop by the player first.</dd>
<dt>The Temple ('4')</dt>
<dd>The Temple deals in basic potions and scrolls, some approved priestly
weapons, as well as prayer books.</dd>
<dt>The Alchemy shop ('5')</dt>
<dd>The Alchemy Shop deals in all types of potions and scrolls.</dd>
<dt>The Magic User's Shop ('6')</dt>
<dd>The Magic User's Shop deals in all sorts of rings, wands, amulets, staves, as
well as magic books.</dd>
<dt>The (Expensive) Black Market ('7')</dt>
<dd>The Black Market will sell and buy anything at extortionate prices.
However it occasionally has <strong>very</strong> good items in it. With the exception
of artifacts, every item found in the dungeon may appear in the black
market.</dd>
<dt>The Tavern ('8')</dt>
<dd>This is a place to stay safely. No monster will ever be able to enter
the Tavern, and fights between players are prohibited in it.</dd>
<dt>The Bookseller ('9')</dt>
<dd>The Bookseller holds supplies of the simpler books needed by magic users,
and will buy the more advanced books which can be found in the dungeon.</dd>
<dt>Your Home ('0')</dt>
<dd>This is your house where you can store objects that you cannot carry on
your travels, or will need at a later date. Only available on no-wilderness
servers.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-wilderness">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id101">2.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Wilderness</a></h3>
<p>The wilderness is the area outside of the Town. It has more houses that can be
bought (inside the &quot;Suburb&quot; area), some &quot;public&quot; buildings, and many monsters
are roaming it. Be careful, as the Wilderness is really dangerous at night!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="within-the-dungeon">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id102">2.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within The Dungeon</a></h3>
<p>Once your character is adequately supplied with food, light, armor, and
weapons, he is ready to enter the dungeon. Move on top of the '&gt;' symbol
and use the &quot;Down&quot; command ('&gt;').</p>
<p>Your character will enter a maze of interconnecting staircases and finally
arrive somewhere on the first level of the dungeon. Each level of the
dungeon is fifty feet high (thus dungeon level &quot;Lev 1&quot; is often called &quot;50
ft&quot;), and is divided into (large) rectangular regions (several times larger
than the screen) by permanent rock. Once you leave a level by a staircase,
you will never again find your way back to that region of that level, but
there are an infinite number of other regions at that same &quot;depth&quot; that you
can explore later. Monsters, of course, can use the stairs, and you may
eventually encounter them again, but they will not chase you up or down
stairs.</p>
<p>In the dungeon, there are many things to find, but your character must
survive many horrible and challenging encounters to find the treasure lying
about and take it safely back to the town to sell.</p>
<p>There are two sources for light once inside the dungeon. Permanent light
which has been magically placed within rooms, and a light source carried by
the player. If neither is present, the character will be unable to see.
This will affect searching, picking locks, disarming traps, reading
scrolls, casting spells, browsing books, etc. So be very careful not to run
out of light!</p>
<p>A character must wield a torch or lamp in order to supply his own light. A
torch or lamp burns fuel as it is used, and once it is out of fuel, it
stops supplying light. You will be warned as the light approaches this
point. You may use the &quot;Fuel&quot; command ('F') to refuel your lamp (with
flasks of oil), and it is a good idea to carry extra torches or flasks of
oil, as appropriate. There are rumours of objects of exceptional power
which glow with their own never-ending light.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objects-found-in-the-dungeon">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id103">2.3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects Found In The Dungeon</a></h3>
<p>The mines are full of objects just waiting to be picked up and used. How
did they get there?  Well, the main source for useful items are all the
foolish adventurers that proceeded into the dungeon before you. They get
killed, and the helpful creatures scatter the various treasure throughout
the dungeon.</p>
<p>Several objects may occupy a given floor location, which may or may not
also contain one creature. However, doors, rubble, traps, and staircases
cannot coexist with items. As below, any item may actually be a &quot;pile&quot;
of up to 40 identical items. With the right choice of &quot;options&quot;, you
may be able to &quot;stack&quot; several items in the same grid.</p>
<p>You pick up objects by moving on top of them. You can carry up to 23
different items in your backpack while wearing and wielding up to 13
others. Although you are limited to 23 different items, each item may
actually be a &quot;pile&quot; of up to 40 similar items. If you 't'ake off an
item, it will go into your backpack if there is room: if there is no room
in your backpack, it will drop onto the floor, so be careful when swapping
one wielded weapon or worn piece of armor for another when your pack is
full.</p>
<p>You are, however, limited in the total amount of weight that you can carry.
As you approach this value, you become slower, making it easier for monsters
to chase you. Your weight &quot;limit&quot; is determined by your strength.</p>
<p>Many objects found within the dungeon have special commands for their use.
Wands must be Aimed, staves must be Used, scrolls must be Read, and potions
must be Quaffed. You may, in general, not only use items in your pack, but
also items on the ground, if you are standing on top of them. At the
beginning of the game, all items are assigned a random 'flavor'. For example
potions of 'cure light wounds' could be 'red potions'. If you have never
used, sold, or bought one of these potions, you will only see the flavor.
You can learn what type of item it is by selling it to a store, or using it
(although learning by use does not always apply to magic devices). Lastly,
items in stores that you have not yet identified the flavor of will be labeled
'{unseen}'.</p>
<p>Chests are complex objects, containing traps, locks, and possibly treasure
or other objects inside them once they are opened. Many of the commands
that apply to traps or doors also apply to chests and, like traps and
doors, these commands do not work if you are carrying the chest.</p>
<p>One item in particular will be discussed here. The scroll of &quot;Word of
Recall&quot; can be found within the dungeon, or bought at the alchemist in town.
All classes start with one of these scrolls in their inventory. It acts in
two manners, depending upon your current location. If read within the
dungeon, it will teleport you back to town. If read in town, it will
teleport you back down to the deepest level of the dungeon which your
character has previously been on. This makes the scroll very useful for
getting back to the deeper levels of Angband. Once the scroll has been read
it takes a while for the spell to act, so don't expect it to save you in a
crisis. During this time the word 'recall' will appear on the bottom of the
screen below the dungeon. Reading a second scroll before the first takes
effect will cancel the action.</p>
<p>You may &quot;inscribe&quot; any object with a textual inscription of your choice.
These inscriptions are not limited in length, though you may not be able to
see the whole inscription on the item. The game applies special meaning to
inscriptions containing any text of the form '&#64;#' or '&#64;x#' or '!x' or
'!*', see 'customize.txt'.</p>
<p>The game provides some &quot;fake&quot; inscriptions to help you keep track of your
possessions. Weapons, armor and jewellery which have properties you don't
know about yet will get a '{??}' label. Wands, staves and rods can get a
'{tried}' label after use, particularly if they have an effect on a monster
and were tested in the absence of monsters.</p>
<p>It is rumored that rings of power and extra rare spell books may be found
deeper in the dungeon...</p>
<p>And lastly, a final warning: not all objects are what they seem. The line
between tasty food and a poisonous mushroom is a fine one, and sometimes a
chest full of treasure will grow teeth in its lid and bite your hand off...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cursed-objects">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id104">2.3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cursed Objects</a></h3>
<p>Some objects, often objects of great power, have been cursed. There are many
curses in the game, and they can appear on any wearable object. Curses may
have a negative (or sometimes positive) effect on an object's properties, or
cause bad things to happen to the player at random.</p>
<p>You can choose to wear the object in spite of its curses, or attempt to
uncurse it using magic. A warning: failed uncursing leads to the object
becoming fragile, and a fragile object may be destroyed on future curse removal
attempts. It is up to you to balance the risks and rewards in your use
of cursed items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mining">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id105">2.3.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mining</a></h3>
<p>Some treasure within the dungeon can be found only by mining it out of the
walls. Many rich strikes exist within each level, but must be found and
mined. Quartz veins are the richest, yielding the most metals and gems, but
magma veins will have some hoards hidden within.</p>
<p>Mining is rather difficult without a pick or shovel. Picks and shovels have
an additional magical ability expressed as '(+#)'. The higher the number,
the better the magical digging ability of the tool.</p>
<p>When a vein of quartz or magma is located, the character may use his pick
or shovel and begin digging out a section. When that section is removed, he
can locate another section of the vein and begin the process again. Since
granite rock is much harder to dig through, it is much faster to follow the
vein exactly and dig around the granite. Eventually, it becomes easier to
simply kill monsters and discover items in the dungeon to sell, than to
walk around digging for treasure. But, early on, mineral veins can be a
wonderful source of easy treasure.</p>
<p>If the character has a scroll, staff, or spell of treasure location, they can
immediately locate all strikes of treasure within a vein shown on the
screen. This makes mining much easier and more profitable.</p>
<p>Note that a character with high strength and/or a heavy weapon does not
need a shovel/pick to dig, but even the strongest character will benefit
from a pick if trying to dig through a granite wall.</p>
<p>It is sometimes possible to get a character trapped within the dungeon by
using various magical spells and items. So it can be a good idea to always
carry some kind of digging tool, even when you are not planning on
tunneling for treasure.</p>
<p>There are rumors of certain incredibly profitable rooms buried deep in the
dungeon and completely surrounded by permanent rock and granite walls,
requiring a digging implement or magical means to enter. The same rumors
imply that these rooms are guarded by incredibly powerful monsters, so
beware!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="traps">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id106">2.3.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traps</a></h3>
<p>There are many traps located in the dungeon of varying danger. These traps
are hidden from sight and are triggered only when your character walks over
them. If you have found a trap you can attempt to 'D'isarm it, but
failure may mean activating it. Traps can be physical dangers such as pits,
or magical runes or inscriptions which will cause an effect when triggered.
Your character may be better at disarming one of these types of traps than
the other.</p>
<p>All characters have a chance to notice traps when they first come into view
(dependent on searching skill). Some players will also get access to magical
means of detecting all traps within a certain radius. If you cast one of these
spells, there will be a 'Dtrap' green label on the bottom of the screen, below
the dungeon map.</p>
<p>Some monsters have the ability to create new traps on the level that may be
hidden, even if the player is in a detected zone. The detection only finds
the traps that exist at the time of detection, it does not inform you of
new ones that have since been created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="staircases-secret-doors-passages-and-rooms">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id107">2.3.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staircases, Secret Doors, Passages, and Rooms</a></h3>
<p>Staircases are the manner in which you get deeper or climb out of the
dungeon. The symbols for the up and down staircases are the same as the
commands to use them. A '&lt;' represents an up staircase and a '&gt;'
represents a down staircase. You must move your character over the
staircase before you can use it.</p>
<p>Each level has at least one up staircase and at least two down staircases.
There are no exceptions to this rule. You may have trouble finding some
well hidden secret doors, or you may have to dig through obstructions to
get to them, but you can always find the stairs if you look hard enough.
Stairs, like permanent rock, and shop entrances, cannot be destroyed by any
means.</p>
<p>Many secret doors are used within the dungeon to confuse and demoralize
adventurers foolish enough to enter, although all secret doors can be
discovered by stepping adjacent to them. Secret doors will sometimes
hide rooms or corridors, or even entire sections of that level of the
dungeon. Sometimes they simply hide small empty closets or even dead ends.
Secret doors always look like granite walls, just like traps always look
like normal floors.</p>
<p>Creatures in the dungeon will generally know and use these secret doors,
and can often be counted on to leave them open behind them when they pass
through.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="level-and-object-feelings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id108">2.3.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level and object feelings</a></h3>
<p>Unless you have disabled the option to get feelings you will get a message
upon entering a dungeon giving you a general feel of how dangerous that
level is.</p>
<p>The possible messages are :
1 - &quot;This seems a quiet, peaceful place&quot;
2 - &quot;This seems a tame, sheltered place&quot;,
3 - &quot;This place seems reasonably safe&quot;,
4 - &quot;This place does not seem too risky&quot;,
5 - &quot;You feel nervous about this place&quot;,
6 - &quot;You feel anxious about this place&quot;,
7 - &quot;This place seems terribly dangerous&quot;,
8 - &quot;This place seems murderous&quot;,
9 - &quot;Omens of death haunt this place&quot;,
This feeling depends only on the monsters present in the dungeon when you
first enter it. It will not get reduced to safer feeling as you kill
monsters neither will it increase if new ones are summoned.
This feeling also depends on your current dungeon depth. A dungeon you
feel nervous about at 2000' is way more dangerous than a murderous one
at 50'.</p>
<p>Once you have explored a certain amount of the dungeon you will also
get a feeling about how good are the objects lying on the floor of the
dungeon.</p>
<p>The possible messages are :
1 - &quot;there are naught but cobwebs here.&quot;
2 - &quot;there are only scraps of junk here.&quot;,
3 - &quot;there aren't many treasures here.&quot;,
4 - &quot;there may not be much interesting here.&quot;,
5 - &quot;there may be something worthwhile here.&quot;,
6 - &quot;there are good treasures here.&quot;,
7 - &quot;there are very good treasures here.&quot;,
8 - &quot;there are excellent treasures here.&quot;,
9 - &quot;there are superb treasures here.&quot;,
$ - &quot;you sense an item of wondrous power!&quot;,
The last message indicates an artifact is present and is only possible
if the preserve option is disabled.</p>
<p>You may review your level feeling any time by using the ^F command.
You may also consult it by checking the LF: indicator at the bottom
left of the screen. The first number after it is the level feeling
and the second one is the object feeling. The second one will be ?
if you need to explore more before getting a feeling about the value
of the treasures present in the dungeon.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id109">2.3.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winning The Game</a></h3>
<p>If your character has killed Sauron (a difficult task), who lives on level
99 (4950') in the dungeon, a magical staircase will appear that will allow
you to finally reach level 100. Morgoth lurks on this level of his dungeon,
and you will not be able to go below his level until you have killed him.
Try to avoid wandering around on level 100 unless you are ready for him,
since he has a habit of coming at you across the dungeon, the Mighty Hammer
'Grond' in hand, to slay you for your impudence.</p>
<p>If you should actually survive the attempt of killing Morgoth, you will
receive the status of WINNER. You may continue to explore, and may even save
the game and play more later, but since you have defeated the toughest
creature alive, there is really not much point. Unless you wish to listen
to the rumors of a powerful ring buried somewhere in the dungeon, or a suit
of dragon scale mail that resists everything... There are even rumors of
creatures of pure evil lurking in the deepest levels of the fortress of
Angband...</p>
<p>When you are ready to retire, simply kill your character (using the 'Q' key)
to have your character entered into the high score list as a winner. Note
that until you retire, you can still be killed, so you may want to retire
before wandering into yet another horde of greater demons.</p>

<div class="section" id="upon-death-and-dying">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id110">2.3.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Death and Dying</a></h3>
<p>If your character falls below 0 hit points, they have died and cannot be
restored... unless you're playing on a server allowing &quot;ghost&quot; characters and
didn't choose the &quot;no ghost&quot; option at birth. In this case, your character
becomes a &quot;ghost&quot;: all worn and carried items are dropped on the floor and the
character is teleported away from death scene, fully healed and able to pass
walls like a regular pass wall monster. At this point, you have three options:
you can leave all your possessions behind, float all your way up to the town
and go revive at the Temple at the cost of half your acquired experience; if
other players are around at your time of death, you can ask a fellow player to
come to the level where you died, kill the monsters that killed you and revive
your character using a Scroll of Life (note that you still lose half of your
experience when resurrecting this way); finally, you may decide to discard your
dead character and start a new one (which is probably the best thing to do
when your character is still low level).</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id111">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacking monsters</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="attacking-and-being-attacked">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id112">2.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attacking and Being Attacked</a></h3>
<p>Attacking is simple in PWMAngband. If you move into a creature, you attack it.
You can attack from a distance by firing a missile or by magical means
(such as aiming a wand). Creatures attack in the same way. If they move
into you, they attack you. Some creatures can also cast spells from a
distance, and others can use various breath weapons (such as fire) on you
from a distance.</p>
<p>Creatures in walls can not be attacked by wands or other magic attacks
normally stopped by walls, nor can they be shot at with bows and arrows.
Tunnelling into the wall (using the &quot;tunnel&quot; or &quot;alter&quot; command) will allow
you to attack any creature in the wall with your main weapon. This applies
to creatures which &quot;pass through&quot; walls: if they &quot;bore through&quot; walls, the
wall is no longer there, and the creature can be targeted normally.</p>
<p>If you are wielding a weapon, the damage for the weapon is used when you
hit a creature. Otherwise you get a single punch which does minimal damage.</p>
<p>You may 'w'ield one weapon for melee combat, and also one missile
launcher (bow, crossbow or sling). You may also wear one amulet (around the
one and only neck of the character), two rings (on the two &quot;ring&quot; fingers,
i.e. the third finger of each hand: a magic ring does not function when
worn on any other finger, nor may two be worn on the same finger), one
light source, and a full set of armor - body armor, shield, helmet, gloves,
boots and a cloak. Digging tools can be used from the tool slot. Any or all
of these items may provide powers to the character in terms of bonuses to-hit,
to-damage, to-armor class, or to other stats.</p>
<p>Firing a missile (while wielding the appropriate launcher) is the only way
to get the &quot;full&quot; power out of the missile. You may of course throw an
arrow at a monster without shooting it, but you will find the effects will
not be what you had hoped.</p>
<p>Hits and misses are determined by ability to hit versus armor class. A hit
is a strike that does some damage; a miss may in fact reach a target, but
fails to do any damage. Higher armor classes make it harder to do damage,
and so lead to more misses. Characters with higher armor classes also
receive a damage reduction. This is not true for monsters, whose AC only
affects the character's difficulty to hit them.</p>
<p>If you wish to see how much damage your weapon will do, you can
'I'nspect it. You will find the number of blows and how much damage you
would do per round, including information on whether your weapon damages
other types of monsters differently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monster-memories">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id113">2.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster Memories</a></h3>
<p>There are hundreds of different creatures in the pits of Angband, many of
which have the same letter symbol and color on the screen. The exact
species of a creature can be discovered by 'l'ooking at it. It is also
very difficult to keep track of the capabilities of various creatures.
Luckily, PWMAngband automatically keeps track of your experiences with a
particular creature. This feature is called the monster memory. Your
monster memory recalls the particular attacks of each creature (whether or
not technically a monster) which you have suffered, as well as recalling if
you have observed them to multiply or move erratically, or drop treasure,
etc. Otherwise you would simply have to take notes, which is an unnecessary
bother.</p>
<p>If you have killed enough of a particular creature, or suffered enough
attacks, recalling the monster memory may also provide you with information
not otherwise available, such as an armor class, hit dice, spell types,
frequency of spell casting, or the amount of damage for breaths or spells.
These attacks will be color coded to inform you of whether or not you
currently resist a specific attack. Red or orange means you do not resist
it, yellow means you partially resist it, and green means you resist it or
are immune. If you attack a monster with specific elemental attacks you will
learn if the monster resists that element or if they are immune. There are
other magical means to learn about monster's abilities that don't require
you to actually experience the attacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-weapon">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id114">2.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Weapon</a></h3>
<p>Carrying a weapon in your backpack does you no good. You must wield a
weapon before it can be used in a fight. A secondary weapon can be kept by
keeping it in the backpack, and switching it with the primary weapon when
needed. This is most often used when carrying two weapons, each of which
provides a rare power that the character needs at two separate times.</p>
<p>Weapons have two main magical characteristics, their enchanted ability to
hit and their enchanted ability to do damage, expressed as '(+#,+#)'. A
normal weapon would be '(+0,+0)'. Many weapons in PWMAngband have bonuses to
hit and/or to damage.</p>
<p>PWMAngband assumes that your youth in the rough environment near the dungeons
has taught you the relative merits of different weapons, and displays as
part of their description the damage dice which define their capabilities.
Any damage enchantment is added to the dice roll for that weapon. The dice
used for a given weapon is displayed as 'XdY'. The number 'X' indicates
how many dice to roll, and number 'Y' indicates how many sides they have.
A '2d6' weapon will thus give damage from 2 to 12, plus any damage bonus.
The weight of a weapon is also a consideration. Heavy weapons may hit
harder, but they are also harder to use. Depending on your strength,
dexterity, character class, and weapon weight, you may get attacks more
quickly: high dexterity and strength and low weapon weight are the main
factors. Warriors may get up to a maximum of 6 attacks per round; mages and
priests are limited to only 4; other classes may get up to 5. Your attacks
per round with a weapon are displayed as a decimal, e.g. 2.3 or 3.4 etc.
The fractions take the form of unused energy which is carried over to your
next turn.</p>
<p>Missile weapons, such as bows, have their characteristics added to those of
the missile used, if the proper weapon/missile combination is used, and
then the launcher multiplier is applied to the total damage, making missile
weapons very powerful given the proper missiles, especially if they are
enchanted. Like weapons, 'I'nspecting ammunition will tell you how much
damage you will do with your current missile launcher.</p>
<p>Finally, some rare weapons have special abilities. These are called ego
weapons, and are feared by great and meek. An ego weapon must be wielded to
receive the benefit of its abilities. It should be noted that some of these
items are considerably more powerful than others, and generally the most
powerful items are the rarest. Some items will have an obvious effect,
like an increase in infravision, or extra strength. These effects will be
noticed as soon as you wield the item. Other effects, like most
resistances, will need to be learned. You can learn them by either
suffering an appropriate attack, or by using magical means of
identification.</p>
<p>Some of the more common ego weapons are described at the end of this file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-armor-class">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id115">2.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Armor Class</a></h3>
<p>Your armor class (or AC) is a number that describes the amount and the
quality of armor being worn. Armor class will generally run from about 0 to
200, though exceptionally good armor can improve even on the latter figure.</p>
<p>The higher your armor class, the more protective it is. A negative armor
class would actually help get you hit. Armor protects you in three manners.
First, it makes you harder to be hit for damage. A hit for no damage counts
as a miss, and is described as a miss. Second, good armor will absorb
some of the damage that your character would have taken from normal
attacks. Third, acid damage is reduced by wearing body armor (but the
armor may be damaged instead). It is obvious that a high armor class is
vital for surviving the deeper levels of Angband.</p>
<p>Armor class values are always displayed between a set of square brackets,
as '[#]' or '[#,+#]'. The first value is the base armor class of the
armor. The second number is the magical bonus of the item, which is only
displayed if known, and will always have a sign preceding the value. These
plusses can be determined by wielding the armor in combat and being hit.
Note that a few rings, amulets, and weapons also have the '[+#]'
notation, indicating that they provide an armor bonus. Many pieces of heavy
body armor will also have a '(-#)' (in normal brackets) before the
'[#,+#]', which indicates that the weight of the armor decreases your
chances of hitting monsters. This can range from nonexistent for very light
armor to '(-8)' for the heaviest armor!</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id116">2.4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monster status effects</a></h3>
<p>You will find some spells and items which can affect monsters in ways which
do not involve directly dealing them damage. These are 'status effects'.

<div class="section" id="non-melee-attacks-and-resistances">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id117">2.4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-melee attacks and resistances</a></h3>
<p>The player may at some time gain access to non-melee attacks, and many
monsters also have them. Perhaps the most famous of this type of attack is
dragon breath, but monsters may also cast spells at the player, and vice
versa. This damage generally is not affected by armor class, and does not
need a hit roll to hit the player or monster being aimed at.</p>
<p>Some attacks are purely magical: attack spells which blind, confuse, slow,
scare or paralyze the target. These attacks are resisted by monsters of
higher level (native to deeper dungeon depths) and characters with a high
saving throw - saving throws being dependent on class, level and wisdom.
There are also available resistances to fear, blindness, confusion and
stunning, and the power of &quot;free action&quot; prevents magical paralysis and
most slowing attacks (the player may still be paralyzed by being &quot;knocked
out&quot; in melee or by a stunning attack, but this is very rare and can be
prevented with protection from stunning.) There are monsters that can
cause status effects such as blindness, paralysis or confusion through
their melee attack. Since this is a physical effect and not a mental one,
the player will not get a saving throw. However, having resistance to
that effect will prevent the negative status in all cases. It should
also be noticed that most unique monsters automatically pass their saving
throws, and some monsters are naturally resistant to confusion, fear and
sleep. Some monsters may have spells that 'cause wounds' that can be
deadly if successful but do no damage if the saving throw is passed.</p>
<p>Some melee attacks by monsters may drain a stat, as can some traps: this is
prevented by having that stat sustained. Drained stats are temporary and
can be restored on gaining a new character level or consuming rare items
found in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Some monsters may cast spells that teleport the player character. There is
no saving throw, except to those that would actually teleport him up or
down one dungeon level. Having resistance to nexus will also prevent being
level-teleported, but will not help against normal teleportation spell
attacks. The player may teleport monsters in the same way, with a spell,
wand or rod. No monsters, even Morgoth himself, can resist this teleportation.
Yet...</p>
<p>Other attacks are usually element-based, including the aforementioned
example of dragon breath. Many monsters can breathe various attacks or cast
bolt or ball spells, and the player may also have access to bolt and ball
spells (or breathe like a dragon, in some rare circumstances). The player,
and the monsters, may be resistant to these forms of attack: resistance is
handled in different ways for the player and the monster, and for different
attack forms.</p>
<p>Bolt spells will hit the first monster (or the player) in the line of fire:
ball spells and breaths may centre on a target which may be hiding behind
other targets. Ball spells and breath weapons affect an area: other
monsters caught in the blast take reduced damage depending on their distance
from the centre of the blast. Breath weapons are proportional to a
fraction of the monster's current hit points, with a maximum cap on the
damage (which is higher for the most common of such attacks, owing to the
fact that the resistances are also easier to find). Bolt and ball spell
damage is calculated differently - often (but not always) relative to
character or monster level.</p>
<p>In the case of fire, cold, lightning, acid and poison, if the monster has
resistance to a player attack of this kind it will take almost no damage.
If the player has one or more permanent sources of resistance, they will take
1/3 of the damage they would normally take: if the player has a temporary
source of resistance (whether from potion, spell or item activation), this
will also reduce the damage to 1/3 of its normal level, allowing the
character to take only 1/9 damage if they have both permanent and temporary
resistance. Having more than one source of permanent resistance confers no
extra bonus, and using more than one source of temporary resistance
increases only the duration of the resistance: in both cases, either the
resistance is present or it is not. But one permanent resistance and one
temporary resistance are both effective simultaneously.</p>
<p>Elemental attacks also have a chance to damage wielded equipment or destroy
items in the character's inventory. Fire attacks destroy scrolls, staves,
magic books and arrows. Acid attacks destroy scrolls, staves, arrows, bolts
and can damage armor. Electricity attacks can destroy wands, rods, rings
and amulets. Cold attacks can destroy potions. Items in your inventory get
a saving throw, and they are unharmed if they pass it. Having resistance to
the element will make an item less likely to be destroyed. Items on the
floor that get caught in an elemental ball or breath are automatically
destroyed without a saving throw. Weapons, armor and chests can also be
destroyed if they are lying on the floor, but cannot be harmed if they are
in your pack.</p>
<p>The character may also gain immunity to fire, cold, lightning and acid if
he is fortunate to find any of the few items that provide these
immunities: immunity means that no damage is taken, and the character's
equipment is also totally protected. Immunities are EXTREMELY rare.</p>
<p>Another attack that the player will come into contact with all too often is
the soul-chilling nature of the undead, which can drain the character's
life experience. Some monsters have a life-draining melee attack, others
may cast ball or bolt spells or, in extreme cases, breathe the very force
of the netherworld (shortened by the game to &quot;nether&quot;.) There are two
powers which are of assistance in this case: that of &quot;hold life&quot; will
prevent 90% of all experience drains, and in the other 10% of cases, the
amount of experience lost will be reduced by 90%. That of &quot;resistance to
nether forces&quot; will provide resistance to nether bolts, balls and breaths,
reducing the damage and preventing any experience drains from these
attacks, but has no effect on melee &quot;hits to drain experience&quot;. Monsters
caught in the blast from a nether ball or breath will take damage
proportional to distance from the centre of the attack, except for undead
who are totally immune. The player may find wands or rods of Drain Life,
which similarly are ineffective on those undead creatures which have no
life to drain: however, the real player equivalent attack spell is the
priest/paladin spell of &quot;Orb of Draining&quot;, a ball spell which does damage
to all monsters, double damage to evil monsters, and is resisted by none.</p>
<p>Other attack forms are rarer, but may include: disenchantment (both in
melee or by a monster breath), chaos (breath or melee, which if unresisted
will cause the player to hallucinate and be confused, and may drain life
experience), nexus (which may teleport the player to the monster, away from
the monster, up or down a level, or swap over two of the player's
&quot;internal&quot; stats), light and darkness (which will blind a character unless
they have protection from blindness or resistance to light or dark), sound
(which will stun a character without sound resistance or protection from
stunning), crystal shards (which will cut a non-resistant character),
inertia (which will slow a character regardless of free action), gravity
(which will blink a character, also stunning and slowing), force (which
will stun the character), plasma (which will stun), time (which may
drain experience regardless of hold life, or drain stats regardless of
sustains), water bolts and balls (which may confuse and stun, and do
considerable damage from high-level monsters), ice bolts (which may
cut and stun, and damage potions), and mana bolts and balls (the latter
usually known as Mana Storms.) Magic missiles are included in the &quot;mana&quot;
category, whether cast by the monster or the player.</p>
<p>In addition items on the ground are especially vulnerable to elemental
effects. Potions on the ground will always be destroyed by cold, shards,
sound and force. Scrolls, staves, books, and non-metal gear will always
get destroyed by fire or plasma. Scrolls, staves, and all non-mithril gear
will be destroyed by acid. Rings, amulets, wands and rods will be
destroyed by lightning and plasma. And finally nearly everything will be
destroyed by a mana storm if left on the ground.</p>
<p>Some attacks may stun or cut the player. These can either be spells or
breath attacks (sound, water balls) or from melee. A stunned character
receives a penalty to hit and is much more likely to fail a spell or
activation. If a character gets very stunned, they may be knocked out and
at the mercy of the enemies. A cut character will slowly lose life until
healed either by potions, spells or natural regeneration. Both stunning and
cut status are displayed at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>There are resistances available to chaos, disenchantment, confusion, nexus,
sound, shards, light and darkness: all of these will reduce the damage and
prevent side-effects other than physical damage. With these resistances, as
with nether resistance, damage is a random fraction: for light and dark, it
is between 4/7 and 4/12, for sound and confusion it is between 5/7 and
5/12, and for chaos, disenchantment, nexus, shards and nether it is between
6/7 and 6/12.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all of these are actually vital to completing
the game: indeed, of the above list, only fire, cold, acid, lightning,
poison and confusion resists are regarded as truly vital, with blindness,
chaos and nether the next most desirable. Some attack forms are not
resistible, but thankfully these are rare: resist shards will prevent all
other magical attacks which cut (namely ice bolts), and confusion resistance
will prevent confusion by a water bolt or ball, but there is no resistance
to the physical damage caused by these following attacks: inertia, force,
gravity, plasma, time, ice, water, mana. There is no resistance to any of
the side-effects of a time attack, or indeed to anything but the stunning
effects of a gravity attack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-on-speed">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id118">2.4.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A note on speed</a></h3>
<p>Monsters which do not move at normal speed generally move &quot;slowly&quot; (-10 to
speed), &quot;fast&quot; (+10), &quot;very fast&quot; (+20) or &quot;incredibly fast&quot; (+30). (It will
surprise nobody that Morgoth is one of the few monsters in the last
category.) This is further adjusted by the fact that any non-unique monster
may have a random adjustment from (-2) to (+2) to its own speed.</p>
<p>Generally, (+10) is exactly double normal speed, and (-10) exactly half.
(+20) is about three times normal speed, but after that there is less
noticeable improvement as speed goes higher - for instance, (+30) is not
quite four times normal speed, and higher values than this are largely
irrelevant. The player may find items which can be worn or wielded that
provide speed bonuses: these may include boots of speed, rings of speed and
a few very rare artifacts. Boots will provide a random 1d10 to speed: rings
of speed may be bigger than that - generally the best that the player will
get is two just over (+10), but individual rings of up to (+23) speed have
been known.</p>
<p>Separate from the question of permanent speed (as determined by the
player's speed items and the monster's natural speed) is that of temporary
speed. The player may cast a spell of haste-self, or use a potion, staff or
rod of speed or use an artifact activation to speed him temporarily: or a
monster may cast a haste-self spell, or be affected by another monster
&quot;shrieking for help&quot; or the player reading a scroll of aggravate monster.
In all cases, (+10) speed is added temporarily to the affected monster or
player. Using two or more sources of temporary speed is cumulative only in
duration - one cannot get from normal speed to (+20) using a potion and a
spell of speed. Spells of temporary slowing (including monsters breathing
inertia or gravity) are handled the same way, with exactly (-10) being
subtracted from the player or monster's speed temporarily, for the duration
of the spell or breath's effect.</p>

<p>Some of the ego weapons that you might find in the dungeon are listed
below. This will give you a small taste of the items that can be found.
However if you wish to discover these items on your own, you may not wish
to continue. Ego weapons are denoted by the following &quot;names&quot;:</p>
<div class="section" id="ego-melee-weapons-and-diggers">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id120">2.4.8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ego Melee Weapons (and Diggers):</a></h4>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>(Defender)</dt>
<dd>A magical weapon that actually helps the wielder defend himself, thus
increasing his/her armor class, and protecting him/her against damage
from fire, cold, acid, lightning, and falls. This weapon also will
increase your stealth, let you see invisible creatures, protect you from
paralyzation and some slowing attacks, and help you regenerate hit points
and mana faster. As a result of the regeneration ability, you will use up
food somewhat faster than normal while wielding such a weapon. These
powerful weapons also will sustain one stat, though this stat will vary
from weapon to weapon.</dd>
<dt>(Holy Avenger)</dt>
<dd>A Holy Avenger is often one of the most powerful weapons. A Holy Avenger
will increase your wisdom and your armor class. This weapon will do
extra damage when used against evil, demonic and undead creatures, and
will also give you the ability to see invisible creatures. These weapons
are basically extremely powerful versions of Blessed Blades and can be
wielded by priests with no penalty. These weapons, like (Defender)
weapons, also will sustain one random stat. They will allow the wielder
to fear no monster, and be aware of the presence of undead and demonic
creatures.</dd>
<dt>(Blessed)</dt>
<dd>A blessed blade will increase your wisdom. If you are a priest, wielding
a non-blessed sword or polearm causes a small penalty while attacking and
may infuriate your god, decreasing the chances that she will accept your
prayers: a blessed blade may be wielded without this penalty. Blessed
blades also have one extra, random, power.</dd>
<dt>Weapon of Westernesse</dt>
<dd>A Weapon of Westernesse is one of the more powerful weapons. It does
extra damage against orcs, trolls, and giants, making the wielder aware of
these types of creatures, while increasing your strength, dexterity, and
constitution. It also lets you see invisible creatures and protects from
paralyzation and some slowing attacks. These blades were made by the
Dunedain.</dd>
<dt>Weapon of Extra Attacks</dt>
<dd>A weapon of extra attacks will allow the wielder to deliver extra attacks
during each round.</dd>
<dt>Elemental Branded Weapons</dt>
<dd>Each of the five elemental attacks has a corresponding weapon which will
do treble its base damage to creatures not resistant to that element. (It
should be noted that the magical damage bonus is not affected by this: a
weapon of Flame '(2d6) (+5,+6)' does 6d6+6 damage per hit, not 6d6+18,
against creatures which are not fire-resistant.) There are weapons of
Flame, Frost, Lightning, Acid and Poison brands.</dd>
<dt>Weapons of Slaying enemies</dt>
<dd>These weapons do extra damage against creatures of a vulnerable type.
Weapons of Slay Evil and Slay Animal do double the base damage, while
weapons of Slay Orc, Troll, Giant, Dragon, Demon and Undead do triple the
base damage. As with elemental branded weapons, the magical damage bonus
is not affected.</dd>
<dt>Weapons of *Slay*ing enemies</dt>
<dd>These weapons, in addition to doing extra damage to your enemies, have
extra powers as well. In each case, one stat is increased. Weapons of
*Slay* Dragon, Demon or Undead are also more powerful against their
opponents, doing five times their base damage rather than the normal
three.</dd>
<dt>Shovels and Picks of Digging</dt>
<dd>These powerful diggers will dig through granite as if it were mere wood,
and mineral veins as if they were butter. Permanent rock is still an
impassable obstacle.</dd>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Launchers of Accuracy</dt>
<dd>These launchers have an unnaturally high to-hit number, making them
extremely accurate.</dd>
<dt>Launchers of Power</dt>
<dd>These launchers do an unnaturally high amount of damage due to their high
to-dam number.</dd>
<dt>Launchers of Extra Shots</dt>
<dd>These launchers allow the wielder to shoot more times per round than
normal.</dd>
<dt>Launchers of Extra Might</dt>
<dd>These launchers have a higher base damage than normally made launchers of
their type. For instance, a 'Long Bow of Extra Might (x3)(+X,+Y)(+1)'
is really a Long Bow '(x4)(+X,+Y)' where '(+X,+Y)' is the standard
to-hit and to-dam. As the damage multiplier with the bow affects
<strong>everything</strong> the base arrow damage, the magical damage bonus on both
the bow and the arrow, and any bonuses for slaying or elemental-branded
arrows - this makes it a powerful weapon.</dd>
<dt>Ammo of Wounding</dt>
<dd>This ammunition - whether it be pebbles, iron shots, arrows, bolts,
seeker arrows or seeker bolts - has big bonuses to-hit and to-damage.</dd>
<dt>Ammo of Elemental Brands, and Ammo of Slaying enemies</dt>
<dd>This works in the same way as melee weapons of the same type: double
damage for slay evil and slay animal, triple damage for all other slays
and for all elemental brands. Unlike melee weapons, the slays and
elemental brands <strong>do</strong> affect the magical damage bonus for ammo.</dd>
</dl>
<p>These are the most common types of ego-weapon: note that they are not the
ONLY ego-items available in the dungeon, there may be more.</p>
<p>Apart from these there are some very rare and well made weapons in the
dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Blades
of Chaos, Maces of Disruption, and Scythes of Slicing. They can also be
ego weapons like the ones above. For example, a Blade of Chaos (Holy
Avenger) is much more powerful than many artifact weapons!</p>
<p>Some pieces of armor will possess special abilities denoted by the following
names:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ego-armors-and-shields">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id122">2.4.8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ego Armors and Shields:</a></h4>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>of Resist Acid, Lightning, Fire or Cold</dt>
<dd>A character wearing armor or a shield with one such resistance will take
only 1/3 of normal damage from attacks involving the relevant element of
acid, lightning, fire or cold. Note that multiple permanent sources of
resistance are NOT cumulative: wearing two is no better than wearing one.
However, armor which provides resistance to acid cannot itself be damaged
by acid, and this is a good reason to wear more than one such piece of
armor.</dd>
<dt>of Resistance</dt>
<dd>A character wearing armor or a shield with this ability will have resistance
to Acid, Cold, Fire, and Lightning as explained in each part above.</dd>
<dt>of Elvenkind</dt>
<dd>This is the same as &quot;of Resistance&quot;, only generally better enchanted. It
will make you more stealthy. It also possesses an extra resistance,
chosen at random from the following list: poison, light, dark,
nexus, nether, chaos, disenchantment, sound, and shards.</dd>
<dt>Robes of Permanence</dt>
<dd>These robes are designed especially for wizards. Just like Elvenkind
armor, they provide resistance to fire, cold, acid, and electricity and
cannot be damaged by acid. They sustain all of your stats and protect you
from a good deal of all experience draining. Also like Elvenkind armor,
they have one random resistance.</dd>
<dt>Dragon Scale Mails</dt>
<dd>These extremely rare pieces of armor come in many different colors, each
protecting you against the relevant dragons. Naturally they are all
resistant to acid damage. They also occasionally allow you to breathe as
a dragon would. Dragon Scale Mails can also have egos as well.</dd>

<dt>Stat Boosting Helms</dt>
<dd>There are magical helms found in the dungeon that have the ability to
boost the wearer's intelligence, or wisdom. In addition to boosting the
relevant stat these helms will also prevent that stat from being drained.</dd>
<dt>Crown of the Magi</dt>
<dd>This is the great crown of the wizards. The wearer will have an increased
(and sustained) intelligence, and will also be given resistance against
fire, frost, acid, and lightning. These valuable helms also have an
additional random power.</dd>
<dt>Crown of Might</dt>
<dd>This is the crown of the warriors. The wearer will have an increased and
sustained strength, dexterity, and constitution, and will also be immune
to any foe's attempt to slow or paralyze him or her.</dd>
<dt>Crown of Lordliness</dt>
<dd>This is the great crown of the priests. The wearer will have an increased
and sustained wisdom, and won't fear any creature. These valuable helms also
have an additional random power.</dd>
<dt>Helm of Seeing</dt>
<dd>This is the great helmet or crown of the rogues. The wearer will be able
to see invisible creatures, and will have an increased ability to locate
traps. It is also rumored that the wearer of such a helm will not be able
to be blinded.</dd>
<dt>Helm of Infravision</dt>
<dd>This helmet allows the character to see monsters even in total darkness,
with the ability to see heat. Note that spellbooks are the same
temperature as the surroundings, and so cannot be read unless some real
light is present. (Some monsters which are invisible to normal vision can
be seen under infravision.)</dd>
<dt>Helm of Light</dt>
<dd>In addition to providing a permanent light source for the wearer, this
helm also provides resistance against light-based attacks.</dd>
<dt>Helm of Telepathic Awareness</dt>
<dd>This helm or crown grants the wearer the ability to sense the presence of
different types of creatures.</dd>
<dt>Helm of Regeneration</dt>
<dd>This helm will help you regenerate hit points and mana more quickly than
normal, allowing you to fight longer before needing to rest. You will use
food faster than normal while wearing this helm because of the
regenerative effects.</dd>

dungeon with not necessarily any special abilities. These include Shields
of Deflection, Adamantite Plate Mail, Mithril Plate Mail, Mithril Chain
Mail, and Elven Cloaks. The first four cannot be damaged by acid because of
the quality metals they contain.</p>
<p>Some rare armours may even possess special abilities, while not being ego items
in themselves. They are denoted by the following names:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Orcish Shield</dt>
<dd>This shield increases strength and constitution. It may have a higher than
average enchantment.</dd>
<dt>Kolla</dt>
<dd>This cloak increases strength, dexterity, constitution, and sustains these
three stats. It may have a higher than average enchantment.</dd>
<dt>Witan Boots</dt>
<dd>These heavy metallic boots have a high base armor class and a higher than
average enchantment. However, the wearer of such boots will make a lot of
noise while wearing them, and therefore will wake up sleeping monsters
more often.</dd>
<dt>Elven Gloves</dt>
<dd>These gloves help the wearer regenerate hit points and mana more quickly
than normal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are rumors of unique &quot;artifact&quot; items in the dungeon - weapons and
armor of all types. Many of these are more powerful than even the greatest
ego-items; some are weak and have little more than a name to recommend
them.</p>

<div class="section" id="playing-the-game">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id127">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing the Game</a></h2>
<p>Most of your interaction with PWMAngband will take the form of &quot;commands&quot;.
Every PWMAngband command consists of an &quot;underlying command&quot; plus a variety of
optional or required arguments, such as a repeat count, a direction, or the
index of an inventory object. Commands are normally specified by typing a
series of keypresses, from which the underlying command is extracted, along
with any encoded arguments. You may choose how the standard &quot;keyboard keys&quot;
are mapped to the &quot;underlying commands&quot; by choosing one of the two standard
&quot;keysets&quot;, the &quot;original&quot; keyset or the &quot;roguelike&quot; keyset.</p>
<p>The original keyset is very similar to the &quot;underlying&quot; command set, with a
few additions (such as the ability to use the numeric &quot;directions&quot; to
&quot;walk&quot; or the '5' key to &quot;stay still&quot;). The roguelike keyset provides
similar additions, and also allows the use of the
'h'/'j'/'k'/'l'/'y'/'u'/'b'/'n' keys to &quot;walk&quot; (or, in
combination with the shift or control keys, to run or alter), which thus
requires a variety of key mappings to allow access to the underlying
commands used for walking/running/altering. In particular, the &quot;roguelike&quot;
keyset includes many more &quot;capital&quot; and &quot;control&quot; keys, as shown below.</p>
<p>Note that any keys that are not required for access to the underlying
command set may be used by the user to extend the &quot;keyset&quot; which is being
used, by defining new &quot;keymaps&quot;. To avoid the use of any &quot;keymaps&quot;, press
backslash ('\') plus the &quot;underlying command&quot; key. You may enter
&quot;control-keys&quot; as a caret ('^') plus the key (so '^' + 'p' yields
'^p').</p>
<p>Some commands allow an optional &quot;repeat count&quot;, which allows you to tell
the game that you wish to do the command multiple times, unless you press a
key or are otherwise disturbed. In PWMAngband, such commands are set on
auto-repeast and a repeat count of 99 is normally applied.</p>
<p>Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction, an
inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the symbol of
a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of time, a
quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you can hit return
to choose the &quot;default&quot; response, or escape to cancel the command entirely.</p>
<p>Some commands will prompt for a spell or an inventory item. Pressing space
(or '*') will give you a list of choices. Pressing '-' (minus) selects
the item on the floor. Pressing a lowercase letter selects the given item.
Pressing a capital letter selects the given item after verification.
Pressing a numeric digit '#' selects the first item (if any) whose
inscription contains '&#64;#' or '&#64;x#', where 'x' is the current
&quot;underlying command&quot;. You may only specify items which are &quot;legal&quot; for the
command. Whenever an item inscription contains '!*' or '!x' (with 'x'
as above) you must verify its selection.</p>
<p>Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a &quot;compass&quot;
direction using any of the &quot;direction keys&quot; shown below. Sometimes, you may
specify that you wish to use the current &quot;target&quot;, by pressing 't' or
'5', or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing '*' (see
&quot;Target&quot; below).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Each of the standard keysets provides some short-cuts over the &quot;underlying
commands&quot;. For example, both keysets allow you to &quot;walk&quot; by simply pressing
an &quot;original&quot; direction key (or a &quot;roguelike&quot; direction key if you are
using the roguelike keyset), instead of using the &quot;walk&quot; command plus a
direction. The roguelike keyset allows you to &quot;run&quot; or &quot;alter&quot; by simply
holding the shift or control modifier key down while pressing a &quot;roguelike&quot;
direction key, instead of using the &quot;run&quot; or &quot;alter&quot; command plus a
direction. Both keysets allow the use of the '5' key to &quot;stand still&quot;,
which is most convenient when using the original keyset.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id130">2.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Keys</a></h3>
<p>Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.</p>
<p>It is often possible to specify &quot;control-keys&quot; without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ('^') followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.</p>
<p>Pressing backslash ('\') before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an &quot;underlying command&quot; key,
unless it is a caret ('^'), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
PWMAngband keyset. The backslash key is useful for creating actions which are
not affected by any keymap definitions that may be in force, for example,
the sequence '\' + '.' + '6' will always mean &quot;run east&quot;, even if the
'.' key has been mapped to a different underlying command.</p>
<p>The '0' and '^' and '\' keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no &quot;useful&quot; way to specify any of them as
an &quot;underlying command&quot;, which is okay, since they would have no effect.</p>
<p>For many input requests or queries, the special character 'ESCAPE' will
abort the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with 'y' or
'n', or 'escape'.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selection-of-objects">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id131">2.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection of Objects</a></h3>
<p>Many commands will prompt for a particular object to be used.
For example, the command to read a scroll will ask you which of the
scrolls that you are carrying that you wish to read. In such cases, the
selection is made by typing a letter of the alphabet (or a number if choosing
from the quiver). The prompt will indicate the possible letters/numbers,
and you will also be shown a list of the appropriate items. Often you will
be able to press '/' to switch between inventory and equipment, or '|' to
select the quiver, or '-' to select the floor. Using the right arrow also
rotates selection between equipment, inventory, quiver, floor and back to
equipment; the left arrow rotates in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower case
letter. If lower case is used, the selection takes place immediately. If
upper case is used, then the particular option is described, and you are
given the option of confirming or retracting that choice. Upper case
selection is thus safer, but requires an extra key stroke.</p>
<p>For more information on selecting object, see 'Customising the game'.</p>

<div class="section" id="command-descriptions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id132">2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command Descriptions</a></h2>
<p>The following command descriptions are listed as the command name plus the
default key to use it. For those who prefer the original &quot;roguelike&quot;
keyset, the name and key of the roguelike command is also shown if it is
different. Then comes a brief description of the command, including
information about alternative methods of specifying the command in each
keyset, when needed.</p>
<p>Some commands use the &quot;repeat count&quot; to automatically repeat the command
several times.</p>
<p>Most commands take no &quot;energy&quot; to perform, while other commands only take
energy when they cause the world to change in some way. For example,
attempting to read a scroll while blind does not use any energy.</p>
<p>The following command is very useful for beginners:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Command lists ('Enter')</dt>
<dd>This brings up a little window in the middle of the screen, in which you
can select what command you would like to use by browsing. If you wish
to begin playing immediately, you can use this option to navigate the
commands and refer to this guide when you need more details about
specific commands.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id133">2.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventory Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Inventory list ('i')</dt>
<dd>Displays a list of objects being carried but not equipped. You can carry
up to 23 different items, not counting those in your equipment. Often,
many identical objects can be &quot;stacked&quot; into a &quot;pile&quot; which will count as
a single item.
Each object has a weight, and if you carry more objects than your strength
permits, you will begin to slow down. The amount of weight you can still
carry without being overencumbered, or the amount of extra weight you are
currently carrying is displayed at the top of the screen.</dd>
<dt>Equipment list ('e')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to display a list of the objects currently being used by
your character. The standard body (which all races currently have) has
13 slots for equipment. Every equipment slot corresponds to a different
location on the body, and each of which may contain only one object at
a time, and each of which may only contain objects of the proper &quot;type&quot;.
For the standard body these are WEAPON (weapon), BOW (missile launcher),
RING (ring) (two of these), AMULET (amulet), LIGHT (light source),
BODY_ARMOR (armor), CLOAK (cloak), SHIELD (shield), HAT (helmet),
GLOVES (gloves), BOOTS (boots), TOOL (digger, tool). You must be
wielding/wearing certain objects to take advantage of their special powers.</dd>
<dt>Quiver list ('|')</dt>
<dd>Missiles that you carry will automatically be put in your quiver. The
quiver has 8 slots; it also takes up inventory space, so every 40
missiles will reduce your number of inventory slots by 1.</dd>
<dt>Drop an item ('d')</dt>
<dd>This drops an item from your inventory or equipment onto the dungeon
floor. If the floor spot you are standing on already has an object in it,
PWMAngband will attempt to drop the item onto an adjacent space. Doors and
traps are considered objects for the purpose of determining if the space
is occupied. This command may take a quantity, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Drop gold ('$')</dt>
<dd>This drops gold from your purse. This command may take a quantity, and takes
some energy.</dd>
<dt>Ignore an item ('k') or Ignore an item ('^D')</dt>
<dd>This ignores (or destroys) an item in your inventory or on the dungeon floor.
When ignored, the game will sometimes prompt you whether to ignore only this
item or all others like it. If the second option is chosen, all similar
items on the floor and in your inventory will be ignored. To view all
items regardless of whether they are ignored, you can use 'K' to
toggle the ignore setting on and off. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Wear/Wield equipment ('w')</dt>
<dd>To wear or wield an object in your inventory, use this command. Since
only one object can be in each slot at a time, if you wear or wield an
item into a slot which is already occupied, the old item will be first be
taken off, and may in fact be dropped if there is no room for it in your
inventory. Wielding ammunition will add it to an empty slot in your
quiver and prompt you to replace a type of ammunition if your quiver is
already full. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Take off equipment ('t') or Take off equipment ('T')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to take off a piece of equipment and return it to your
inventory. Occasionally, you will run into a cursed item which cannot be
removed. These items normally penalize you in some way and cannot be
taken off until the curse is removed. If there is no room in your
inventory for the item, your pack will overflow and you will drop the
item after taking it off. You may also remove ammunition from your quiver
with this command. This command takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id134">2.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Movement Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Moving (arrow keys, number keys) or (arrow keys, number keys, 'yuhjklbn')</dt>
<dd>This causes you to move one step in a given direction. If the square you
wish to move into is occupied by a monster, you will attack it. If the
square is occupied by a door or a trap you may attempt to open or disarm
it if the appropriate option is set. Preceding this command with CTRL
will cause you to attack in the appropriate direction, but will not move
your character if no monster is there. These commands take some energy.</dd>
<dt>Walk ('W') or Walk ('-')</dt>
<dd>The walk command lets you willingly walk into a trap or a closed door,
without trying to open or disarm it. This command requires a direction, and
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Run ('.') or Run (',')</dt>
<dd>This command will move in the given direction, following any bends in the
corridor, until you either have to make a &quot;choice&quot; between two directions
or you are disturbed. You can configure what will disturb you by setting
the disturbance options. You may also use shift plus the &quot;roguelike&quot;
direction keys (roguelike keyset), or shift plus the &quot;original&quot; direction
keys on the keypad (both keysets, some machines) to run in a direction.
This command may take an argument, requires a direction, and takes some
energy.</dd>
<dt>Go up staircase ('&lt;')</dt>
<dd>Climbs up an up staircase you are standing on. There is always at least
one staircase going up on every level except for the town level (this
doesn't mean it's easy to find). Going up a staircase will take you to a
new dungeon level unless you are at 50 feet (dungeon level 1), in which
case you will return to the town level. Note that whenever you leave a
level (not the town), you will never find it again. This means that for
all intents and purposes, any objects on that level are destroyed. This
includes artifacts unless the &quot;Create characters in preserve mode&quot; option
was set when your character was created, in which case the artifacts may
show up again later. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Go down staircase ('&gt;')</dt>
<dd>Descends a down staircase you are standing on. There is always at least
one staircase going down on each level, except for &quot;quest&quot; levels, which
have none until the quest monster is killed. Going down a staircase will
take you to a new dungeon level. See &quot;Go Up Staircase&quot; for more info.
This command takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id135">2.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resting Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Stay still (with pickup) (',') or Stay still (with pickup) ('.')</dt>
<dd>Stays in the same square for one move. If you normally pick up objects
you encounter, you will pick up whatever you are standing on. You may
also use the '5' key (both keysets). This command naturally bypasses the
&quot;ignore&quot; settings: to pick up things with ignore settings activated,
use the &quot;Get objects&quot; command. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Get objects ('g')</dt>
<dd>Pick up objects and gold on the floor beneath you. You may pick up objects
until the floor is empty or your backpack is full.</dd>
<dt>Do autopickup ('^A')</dt>
<dd>Pick up objects you would normally pick up automatically.</dd>
<dt>Rest ('R')</dt>
<dd>Resting is better for you than repeatedly staying still, and can be told
to automatically stop after a certain amount of time, or when various
conditions are met. In any case, you always wake up when anything
disturbing happens, or when you press any key. To rest, enter the Rest
command, followed by the number of turns you want to rest, or '*' to
rest until your hitpoints and mana are restored, or '&amp;' to rest until
you are fully &quot;healed&quot;. This command may take an argument (used for the
number of turns to rest), and takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id136">2.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stealth Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Toggle stealth mode ('S') or Toggle stealth mode ('#')</dt>
<dd>Only Rogues are able to use this command. When first pressed, the message
&quot;Stealth Mode&quot; will appear at the bottom of the screen. You are now taking
two turns for each command, one for the command and one to act carefully.
This means that you are taking twice the time to move around the dungeon, and
therefore twice the food. Stealth mode will automatically turn off if you are
disturbed. You may also turn off stealth mode by entering the Stealth Mode
command again.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id5">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id137">2.6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alter Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Tunnel ('T') or Tunnel ('^T')</dt>
<dd>Tunnelling or mining is a very useful art. There are many kinds of rock,
with varying hardness, including permanent rock (permanent), granite
(very hard), quartz veins (hard), magma veins (soft), and rubble (very
soft). Quartz and Magma veins may be displayed in a special way, and may
sometimes contain treasure, in which case they will be displayed in a
different way. Rubble sometimes covers an object but is easy to tunnel
through, even with your bare hands. Tunnelling ability increases with
strength and weapon weight. This command requires a direction, and takes
some energy.</dd>
<dt>Open a door or chest ('o')</dt>
<dd>To open an object such as a door or chest, you must use this command. If
the object is locked, you will attempt to pick the lock based on your
disarming ability. If you open a trapped chest without disarming the
traps first, the trap will be set off. Some doors will be locked shut and
may have to be forced open. Opening will automatically attempt to pick
any locked doors. You may need several tries to open a door or chest. This
command requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Close a door ('c')</dt>
<dd>Non-intelligent and some other creatures cannot open doors, so shutting
doors can be quite valuable. Furthermore, monsters cannot see you behind
closed doors, so closing doors may allow you to buy some time without
being attacked. Broken doors cannot be closed. This command requires
a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Disarm a trap or chest, or lock a door ('D')</dt>
<dd>You can attempt to disarm traps on the floor or on chests. If you fail,
there is a chance that you will blunder and set it off. You can only
disarm a trap after you have found it. The command can also be used to lock
a closed door. This will create a hindrance for monsters. Even if many
monsters will be able to pick the lock or bash the door down, it will often
take them some time. This command requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Alter ('+')</dt>
<dd>This special command allows the use of a single keypress to select any of
the &quot;obvious&quot; commands above (attack, tunnel, open, disarm),
and, by using keymaps, to combine this keypress with directions. In
general, this allows the use of the &quot;control&quot; key plus the appropriate
&quot;direction&quot; key (including the roguelike direction keys in roguelike
mode) as a kind of generic &quot;alter the terrain feature of an adjacent
grid&quot; command. This command requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Steal ('J') or Steal ('S')</dt>
<dd>This command allows you to steal gold or items from other players. Stealing
is usually disabled on most of the servers. If allowed, a failed attempt at
stealing will make the offended player automatically hostile.
This command also allows rogues to try and steal gold or items from sleeping
monsters. Stealing works better when the player is stealthy and faster than
the target monster. A failed theft will wake the monster.
This command requires a direction, and takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Drink/fill an empty bottle from a fountain ('_')</dt>
<dd>When standing on a fountain square, this command allows you to interact with
the fountain. Dried out fountains will produce no effect. If you carry empty
bottles, the command will allow you to fill one empty bottle and generate
a random potion. If you don't carry empty bottles, or if you don't want to
fill a bottle, the command will allow you to drink from the fountain.
Drinking from a fountain will produce a random potion effect, which will
range from very good to very bad. Sometimes, other effects may be
experienced. This command takes some energy.</dd>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id138">2.6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell and Prayer Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Browse a book ('b') or Peruse a book ('P')</dt>
<dd>Only spellcasters can read spell or prayer books. Fighters cannot read any
books. When this command is used, all of the spells or prayers contained in
the selected book are displayed, along with information such as their level,
the amount of mana required to cast them, and whether or not you know the
spell or prayer.</dd>
<dt>Gain new spells or prayers ('G')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to actually learn new spells or prayers. When you are
able to learn new spells or prayers, the word &quot;Study&quot; will appear on the
status line at the bottom of the screen. If you have a book in your
possession, containing spells or prayers which you may learn, then you
may choose to study that book. If you are a mage-like spellcaster, you
may actually choose which spell to study. If you are a priest or paladin,
your gods will choose a prayer for you. There are several books of each
type, some of which are normally found only in the dungeon. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Cast a spell or pray a prayer ('m')</dt>
<dd>To cast a spell, you must have previously learned the spell and must have
in your inventory a book from which the spell can be read. Each spell has
a chance of failure which starts out fairly large but decreases as you
gain levels. If you don't have enough mana to cast a spell, you cannot cast
the spell. Since you must read the spell from a book, you cannot be blind or
confused while casting, and there must be some light present. Use this
command when your character is turned into a ghost (after dying, if the
server allows the feature). Unlike spells and prayers, undead abilities use
experience as &quot;fuel&quot;. If you don't have enough experience to invoke an undead
power, your character is destroyed permanently. Shapechangers that polymorph
into a form that can cast spells are able to use this command. If you don't
have enough mana to cast a monster spell, you cannot cast that spell. This
command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Project a spell or a prayer ('p')</dt>
<dd>Sometimes you may want to cast a spell or recite a prayer, aiming it at
a specific friendly player. This command requires a direction and can use
a target. This command takes some energy.</dd>

<dt>Use dragon breath attack ('y') or Use dragon breath attack ('f')</dt>
<dd>Only Dragons or Shapechangers that polymorph into a form that can use breath
attacks are able to use this command. Unlike spells and prayers, breath
attacks use hit points as &quot;fuel&quot;. If you don't have enough hit points to
invoke a breath attack, your character dies. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Polymorph into a monster ('V')</dt>
<dd>Only Shapechangers are able to use this command. Press '*' to display a
list of available forms, or enter a number to polymorph into the form

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id140">2.6.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Object Manipulation Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Eat some food ('E')</dt>
<dd>You must eat regularly to prevent starvation. As you grow hungry, a
message will appear at the bottom of the screen saying &quot;Hungry&quot;. If you
go hungry long enough, you will become weak, then start fainting, and
eventually, you may well die of starvation. You may use this command to
eat food in your inventory. Note that you can sometimes find food in the
dungeon, but it is not always wise to eat strange food. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Fuel your lantern/torch ('F')</dt>
<dd>If you are using a lantern and have flasks of oil in your pack, then you
can &quot;refuel&quot; them with this command. Torches and Lanterns are limited
in their maximal fuel. In general, two flasks will fully fuel a lantern.
This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Quaff a potion ('q')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to drink a potion. Potions affect the player in various
ways, but the effects are not always immediately obvious. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Read a scroll ('r')</dt>
<dd>Use this command to read a scroll. Scroll spells usually have an area
effect, except for a few cases where they act on other objects. Reading a
scroll causes the parchment to disintegrate as the scroll takes effect.
Most scrolls which prompt for more information can be aborted (by
pressing escape), which will stop reading the scroll before it
disintegrates. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Inscribe an object ('{')</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This command inscribes a string on an object. The inscription is displayed
inside curly braces after the object description. The inscription is limited
to the particular object (or pile) and is not automatically transferred to
all similar objects. Under certain circumstances, PWMAngband will display
&quot;fake&quot; inscriptions on certain objects ('cursed', 'tried', 'empty')
when appropriate. These &quot;fake&quot; inscriptions remain all the time, even if the
player chooses to add a &quot;real&quot; inscription on top of it later.</p>
<p>In addition, PWMAngband will place the inscription '??' on an object for you
if the object has a property (or &quot;rune&quot;) that you have not learned yet.
This inscription will remain until you know all the runes on the object.</p>
<p class="last">An item labeled as '{empty}' was found to be out of charges, and an
item labeled as '{tried}' is a &quot;flavored&quot; item which the character has
used, but whose effects are unknown. Certain inscriptions have a meaning
to the game, see '&#64;#', '&#64;x#', '!*', and '!x', in the section on
inventory object selection.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Uninscribe an object ('}')</dt>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id141">2.6.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magical Object Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Activate an object ('A')</dt>
<dd>You have heard rumors of special weapons and armor deep in the Pits,
items that can let you breathe fire like a dragon or light rooms with
just a thought. Should you ever be lucky enough to find such an item,
this command will let you activate its special ability. Special abilities
can only be used if you are wearing or wielding the item. This command
takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Aim a wand ('a') or Zap a wand ('z')</dt>
<dd>Wands must be aimed in a direction to be used. Wands are magical devices,
and therefore there is a chance you will not be able to figure out how to
use them if you aren't good with magical devices. They will fire a shot
that affects the first object or creature encountered or fire a beam that
affects anything in a given direction, depending on the wand. An
obstruction such as a door or wall will generally stop the effects from
traveling any farther. This command requires a direction and can use a
target. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Use a staff ('u') or Zap a staff ('Z')</dt>
<dd>This command will use a staff. A staff is normally very similar to a
scroll, in that they normally either have an area effect or affect a
specific object. Staves are magical devices, and there is a chance you
will not be able to figure out how to use them. This command takes some
energy.</dd>
<dt>Zap a rod ('z') or Activate a rod ('a')</dt>
<dd>Rods are extremely powerful magical items, which cannot be burnt or
shattered, and which can have either staff-like or wand-like effects, but
unlike staves and wands, they don't have charges. Instead, they draw on
the ambient magical energy to recharge themselves, and therefore can only
be activated once every few turns. The recharging time varies depending
on the type of rod. This command may require a direction (depending on
the type of rod, and whether you are aware of its type) and can use a
target. This command takes some energy.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="section" id="id10">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id142">2.6.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing and Missile Weapons</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Fire an item ('f') or Fire an item ('t')</dt>
<dd>This command will allow you to fire a missile from either
your quiver or your inventory provided it is the appropriate ammunition
for the current missile weapon you have equipped. You may not fire an
item without a missile weapon equipped. Fired ammunition has a chance of
breaking. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Fire default ammo at nearest ('h') or ('TAB')</dt>
<dd>If you have a missile weapon equipped and the appropriate ammunition in
your quiver, you can use this command to fire at the nearest visible
enemy. This command will cancel itself if you lack a launcher, ammunition
or a visible target that is in range. The first ammunition of the correct
type found in the quiver is used. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Throw an item ('v')</dt>
<dd>You may throw any object carried by your character. Depending on the
weight, it may travel across the room or drop down beside you. Only one
object from a pile will be thrown at a time. Note that throwing an object
will often cause it to break, so be careful! If you throw something at a
creature, your chances of hitting it are determined by your plusses to
hit, your ability at throwing, and the object's plusses to hit. Once the
creature is hit, the object may or may not do any damage to it.
Note that flasks of oil will do some fire damage to a monster on impact.
If you are wielding a missile launcher compatible with the object you are
throwing, then you automatically use the launcher to fire the missile
with much higher range, accuracy, and damage, than you would get by just
throwing the missile. Throw, like fire, requires a direction. Targeting
mode (see the next command) can be invoked with '*' at the
'Direction?' prompt. This command takes some energy.</dd>
<dt>Targeting Mode ('*')</dt>
<dd>This will allow you to aim your ranged attacks at a specific monster or
grid, so that you can point directly towards that monster or grid (even
if this is not a &quot;compass&quot; direction) when you are asked for a direction.
You can set a target using this command, or you can set a new target at
the &quot;Direction?&quot; prompt when appropriate. At the targeting prompt, you
have many options. First of all, targeting mode starts targeting nearby
monsters which can be reached by &quot;projectable&quot; spells and thrown objects.
In this mode, you can press 't' (or '5' or '.') to select the
current monster, space to advance to the next monster, '-' to back up to
the previous monster, direction keys to advance to a monster more or less
in that direction, 'r' to &quot;recall&quot; the current monster, 'q' to exit
targeting mode, and 'p' (or 'o') to stop targeting monsters and
enter the mode for targeting a location on the floor or in a wall. Note
that if there are no nearby monsters, you will automatically enter this
mode. Note that hitting 'o' is just like 'p', except that the
location cursor starts on the last examined monster instead of on the
player. In this mode, you use the &quot;direction&quot; keys to move around, and
the 'q' key to quit, and the 't' (or '5' or '.') key to target
the cursor location. Note that targeting a location is slightly
&quot;dangerous&quot;, as the target is maintained even if you are far away. To
cancel an old target, simply hit '*' and then 'ESCAPE' (or 'q').
Note that when you cast a spell or throw an object at the target
location, the path chosen is the &quot;optimal&quot; path towards that location,
which may or may not be the path you want. Sometimes, by clever choice of
a location on the floor for your target, you may be able to convince a
thrown object or cast spell to squeeze through a hole or corridor that is
blocking direct access to a different grid. Launching a ball spell or
breath weapon at a location in the middle of a group of monsters can
often improve the effects of that attack, since ball attacks are not
stopped by interposed monsters if the ball is launched at a target.</dd>
<dt>Target friendly player ('left-paren')</dt>
<dd>This command allows you to aim your ranged attacks at a specific friendly
player. If more than one target is available, the most wounded teammate is
chosen.</dd>
<dt>Target closest monster (''')</dt>
<dd>This will allow you to aim your ranged attacks at the closest valid target.</dd>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id143">2.6.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking Commands</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Full screen map ('M')</dt>
<dd>This command will show a map of the entire dungeon, reduced by a factor
of nine, on the screen. Only the major dungeon features will be visible
because of the scale, so even some important objects may not show up on
the map. This is particularly useful in locating where the stairs are
relative to your current position, or for identifying unexplored areas of
the dungeon.
Using this command while in the wilderness (or in Town) will also display
a small-scale map of the level.</dd>
<dt>Locate player on map ('L') or Where is the player ('W')</dt>
<dd>This command lets you scroll your map around, looking at all sectors of
the current dungeon level, until you press escape, at which point the map
will be re-centered on the player if necessary. To scroll the map around,
simply press any of the &quot;direction&quot; keys. The top line will display the
sector location, and the offset from your current sector.</dd>
<dt>Look around ('l') or Examine things ('x')</dt>
<dd>This command is used to look around at nearby monsters (to determine
their type and health) and objects (to determine their type). It is also
used to find out if a monster is currently inside a wall, and what is
under the player. When you are looking at something, you may hit space
for more details, or to advance to the next interesting monster or
object, or minus ('-') to go back to the previous monster or object,
or a direction key to advance to the nearest interesting monster or
object (if any) in that general direction, or 'r' to recall
information about the current monster race, or 'q' or escape to stop
looking around. You always start out looking at &quot;yourself&quot;.</dd>
<dt>Inspect an item ('I')</dt>
<dd>This command lets you inspect an item. This will tell you things about
the special powers of the object, as well as attack information for
weapons. It will also tell you what resistances or abilities you have
noticed for the item and if you have not yet completely identified all
properties.</dd>
<dt>List visible monsters ('[')</dt>
<dd>This command lists all monsters that are visible to you, telling you how
many there are of each kind. It also tells you whether they are asleep,
and where they are (relative to you).</dd>
<dt>List visible items (']')</dt>
<dd>This command lists all items that are visible to you, telling you how of
each there are and where they are on the level relative to your current
location.</dd>
<dt>Full wilderness map ('^W')</dt>
<dd>This command will show a metamap of the world, relative to your current
position on the world map. This is particularly useful in locating where
the Town is relative to your current position, or for identifying unexplored
areas of the wilderness. Note that using this command while in the dungeon
will have the same effect as using the command in the Town.</dd>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id151">2.6.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special Keys</a></h3>
<p>Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.</p>
<p>It is often possible to specify &quot;control-keys&quot; without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ('^') followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.</p>
<p>Pressing backslash ('\') before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an &quot;underlying command&quot; key,
unless it is a caret ('^'), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
PWMAngband keyset. For example, the sequence '\' + '.' + '6' will always
mean &quot;run east&quot;, even if the '.' key has been mapped to a different
underlying command.</p>
<p>The '0' and '^' and '\' keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no &quot;useful&quot; way to specify any of them as
an &quot;underlying command&quot;, which is okay, since they would have no effect.</p>
<p>For many input requests or queries, the special character ESCAPE will abort
the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with 'y' or 'n', or
'ESCAPE'.</p>

a trigger for the time bubble slowdown effect.</p>
<p>The 'delay_factor' value, if non-zero, will slow down the visual effects

to 6 (all items except artifacts). This value can be set for nine different
categories of items: jewelry, dragon scale mails, melee weapons, missiles that
can be fired, missiles that can be thrown, other wearable items, books, junk
items and other consumable items.</p>
<p>The 'lazymove_delay' value, if non-zero, is the maximum time delay allowed by
the game to let two directional keystrokes pressed in short succession act

<div class="section" id="customising-the-game">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id158">2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customising the game</a></h2>
<p>PWMAngband supports multiple customizations. These can vary from alternative
methods for selecting objects, keymaps for different commands, changing the
visuals (using graphical tiles), creating subwindows, and saving
customizations for use on future characters.</p>
<div class="section" id="user-pref-files">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id159">2.8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files</a></h3>
<p>PWMAngband allows you to change various aspects of the game to suit your
tastes. You may define keymaps (changing the way PWMAngband maps your
keypresses to underlying commands), modify the visuals (allowing you to change
the appearance of monsters, objects, or terrain features), change the colors
(allowing you to make a given color brighter, darker, or even completely
different), or set options (turning them off or on).</p>
<p>PWMAngband stores your preferences in files called &quot;user pref files&quot;, which
contain comments and &quot;user pref commands&quot;, which are simple strings describing
one aspect of the system about which the user has a preference. There are many
ways to load a user pref file, and in fact, some of these files are
automatically loaded for you by the game. All of the files are kept in the
&quot;lib/user/&quot; directory, though you may have to use one of the command line
arguments to redirect this directory, especially on multiuser systems. You may
also enter single user pref commands directly, using the special &quot;Enter a user
pref command&quot; command, activated by &quot;double quote&quot;. You may have to use the
&quot;redraw&quot; command ('^R') after changing certain of the aspects of the game, to
allow PWMAngband to adapt to your changes.</p>
<p>When the game starts up, after you have loaded an old character, or created a
new character, some user pref files are loaded automatically. First, the
&quot;pref.prf&quot; file is loaded. This file contains some user pref commands which
will work on all platforms. Then one of 'font-xxx.prf' (for normal usage) or
'graf-xxx.prf' (for bitmap usage) is loaded. These files contain attr/char
changes to allow the monsters, objects, and/or terrain features to look
&quot;better&quot; on your system. Then the 'pref-xxx.prf' file is loaded. This file
contains pre-defined system specific stuff (keymaps, color definitions, etc).
Then, the 'user-xxx.prf' file is loaded. This file contains user-defined
system specific stuff. The 'user-xxx.prf' file is used as the &quot;default&quot; user
pref file in many places. The 'xxx' is the &quot;system suffix&quot; for your system,
taken from the 'main-xxx.c' file which was used to generate your executable.
Finally, the 'Race.prf', 'Class.prf', and 'Name.prf' files are loaded, where
'Race', 'Class', and 'Name' are replaced by the actual race, class, and name
of the current character.</p>
<p>Several options menu items allow you to load existing user pref files, create
new user pref files, append information to existing user pref files, and/or
interact with various of the user preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ignore-settings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id160">2.8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ignore settings</a></h3>
<p>PWMAngband allows you to ignore specific items that you don't want to see
anymore. These items are marked 'ignored' and any similar items are hidden
from view. The easiest way to ignore an item is with the 'k' (or '^D')
command; the object is dropped and then hidden from view. When ignoring an
object, you will be given a choice of ignoring just that object, or all
objects like it in some way.</p>
<p>The entire ignoring system can also be accessed from the options menu ('=')
by choosing &quot;i) Item ignoring setup&quot;. This allows ignore settings for
non-wearable items, and quality and ego ignore settings (described below)
for wearable items, to be viewed or changed.</p>
<p>There is a quality setting for each wearable item type. Ignoring a wearable
item will prompt you with a question about whether you wish to ignore all of
that type of item with a certain quality setting, or of an ego type, or both.</p>
<p>The quality settings are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>worthless</dt>
<dd>Weapon/armor with negative AC, to-hit or to-dam, or item with zero base cost.</dd>
<dt>average</dt>
<dd>Weapon/armor with no pluses no minuses, or any other non-magical item.</dd>
<dt>good</dt>
<dd>Weapon/armor with positive AC, to-hit or to-dam, but without any special
abilities, brands, slays, stat-boosts, resistances, or magical items.</dd>

<div class="section" id="using-inscriptions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id161">2.8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Inscriptions</a></h3>
<p>Inscriptions are notes you can mark on objects using the '{' command. You can
use this to give the game commands about the object, which are listed below.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Inscribing an item with '=g':</dt>
<dd>This marks an item as 'always pick up'. This is sometimes useful for
picking up ammunition after a shootout.</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '!' followed by a command letter or '*':</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This means &quot;prevent me from using this item&quot;. '!w' means 'prevent me from
wielding', '!d' means 'prevent me from dropping', and so on. If you
inscribe an item with '!*' then the game will prevent any use of the item.</p>
<p>Say you inscribed your potion of Speed with '!q'. This would prevent
you from drinking it to be sure you really meant to.</p>
<p>Similarly, using !v!k!d makes it very hard for you to accidentally
throw, ignore or put down the item it is inscribed on.</p>
<p class="last">Some adventurers use this for Scrolls of Word of Recall so they don't
accidentally return to the dungeon too soon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '&#64;', followed by a command letter, followed by 0-9:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Normally when you select an item from your inventory you must enter the
letter that corresponds to the item. Since the order of your inventory
changes as items get added and removed, this can get annoying. You
can instead assign certain items numbers when using a command so that
wherever they are in your backpack, you can use the same keypresses.
If you have multiple items inscribed with the same thing, the game will
use the first one.</p>
<p>For example, if you inscribe a staff of Cure Light Wounds with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;u1">'&#64;u1</a>',
you can refer to it by pressing 1 when 'u'sing it. You could also
inscribe a wand of Wonder with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;a1">'&#64;a1</a>', and when using 'a', 1 would select
that wand.</p>
<p class="last">Spellcasters should inscribe their books, so that if they lose them they
do not cast the wrong spell. If you are mage and the beginner's spellbook
is the first in your inventory, casting 'maa' will cast magic missile. But
if you lose your spellbook, casting 'maa' will cast the first spell in
whatever new book is in the top of your inventory. This can be a waste in
the best case scenario and exceedingly dangerous in the worst! By
inscribing your spellbooks with <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;m1">'&#64;m1</a>', <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#64;m2">'&#64;m2</a>', etc., if you lose your first
spellbook and attempt to cast magic missile by using 'm1a', you cannot
accidentally select the wrong spellbook.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Inscribing an item with '^', followed by a command letter:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">When you inscribe an item with '^', the game prevents you from doing that
action. You might inscribe '^&gt;' on an item if you want to be reminded to
take it off before going down stairs.</p>
<p class="last">Like with '!', you can use '*' for the command letter if you want the game
to prevent you from doing any action. This can get very annoying!</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subwindows">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id162">2.8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subwindows</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the main window, you can create additional window displays
that have other secondary information on them. You can access the subwindow
menu by using '=' then 'w'. You can select what windows to display. You
may then need to make the window visible using the &quot;window&quot; pull down menu
from the menu bar. There are a variety of subwindow choices and you should
experiment to see which ones are the most useful for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-pref-files-keymaps">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id163">2.8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files (Keymaps)</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Interact with keymaps&quot; menu allows you to set up keymaps. Keymaps map
a single keypress to a series of keypresses. For example you might map the
key F1 to &quot;maa&quot; (the keypresses to cast &quot;Magic Missile&quot; as a spellcaster).
This can speed up access to commonly-used features.</p>
<p>Keymaps have two parts: the trigger key and the action. These are written
where possible just as ordinary characters. However, if modifier keys
(shift, control, etc.) are used then they are encoded as special characters
within curly braces {}.</p>
<p>Possible modifiers are:</p>
<blockquote>
K = Keypad (for numbers)
M = Meta (Cmd-key on OS X, alt on most other platforms)
^ = Control
S = Shift</blockquote>
<p>If the only modifier is the control key, the curly braces {} aren't included.
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
{^K}2 = Control-Keypad-2
^D    = Control-D</blockquote>
<p>Special keys, like F1, F2, or Tab, are all written within square brackets [].
For example:</p>
<blockquote>
^[F1]     = Control-F1
{^S}[Tab] = Control-Shift-Tab</blockquote>
<p>Special keys include [Escape].</p>
<p>The game will run keymaps in whatever keyset you use (original or roguelike).
So if you write keymaps for roguelike keys and switch to original keys, they
may not work as you expect! Keymap actions aren't recursive either, so if you
had a keymap whose trigger was F1, including F1 inside the action wouldn't run
the keymap action again.</p>
<p>Keymaps are written in pref files as:</p>
<blockquote>
A:&lt;action&gt;
C:&lt;T&gt;:&lt;trigger&gt;</blockquote>
<p>The action must always come first, &lt;T&gt; means 'keyset Type', which is either
0 for the original keyset or 1 for the roguelike keyset. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
A:maa
C:0:[F1]</blockquote>
<p>PWMAngband uses a few built-in keymaps. These are for the movement keys (they
are mapped to ';' plus the number, e.g. '5' -&gt; ';5'), amongst others. You
can see the full list in pref.prf but they shouldn't impact on you in any way.</p>
<p>To avoid triggering a keymap, you can use the backslash ('\') command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-pref-files-colors">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id164">2.8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User Pref Files (Colors)</a></h3>
<p>The &quot;Interact with colors&quot; menu allows you to change the actual internal
values used to display various colors. This command may or may not have any
effect on your machine. Advanced machines may allow you to change the
actual RGB values used to represent each of the 16 colors used by PWMAngband,
and perhaps even allow you to define new colors which are not currently
used by PWMAngband.</p>

<div class="section" id="brief-version-history">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id169">3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brief Version History</a></h3>
<p>First came &quot;VMS Moria&quot;, by Robert Alan Koeneke (1985).</p>
<p>Then came &quot;Umoria&quot; (Unix Moria), by James E. Wilson (1989).</p>
<p>Details about the history of the various flavors of &quot;Moria&quot;, the direct
ancestor to Angband, can be found elsewhere, and a note from Robert Alan
Koeneke is included in this file. Note that &quot;Moria&quot; has been ported to a
variety of platforms, and has its own newsgroup, and its own fans.</p>
<p>In 1990, Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand, with the help of other students at
the University of Warwick, created Angband 1.0, based on the existing code
for Umoria 5.2.1. They wanted to expand the game, keeping or even
strengthening the grounding in Tolkien lore, while adding more monsters and
items, including unique monsters and artifact items, plus activation,
pseudo-sensing, level feelings, and special dungeon rooms.</p>
<p>Over time, Sean Marsh, Geoff Hill, Charles Teague, and others, worked on
the source, releasing a copy known as &quot;Angband 2.4.frog_knows&quot; at some
point, which ran only on Unix systems, but which was ported by various
people to various other systems. One of the most significant ports was the
&quot;PC Angband 1.4&quot; port, for old DOS machines, which added color and various
other significant changes, only some of which ever made it back into the
official source.</p>
<p>Then Charles Swiger (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:cs4w+&#64;andrew.cmu.edu">cs4w+&#64;andrew.cmu.edu</a>) took over, sometime in late
1993, cleaning up the code, fixing a lot of bugs, and bringing together
various patches from various people, resulting in several versions of
Angband, starting with Angband 2.5.1 (?), and leading up to the release of
Angband 2.6.1 (and Angband 2.6.2) in late 1994. Some of the changes during
this period were based on suggestions from the &quot;net&quot;, and from various
related games, including &quot;UMoria 5.5&quot;, &quot;PC Angband 1.4&quot;, and &quot;FAngband&quot;.</p>
<p>Angband 2.6.1 was primarily targeted towards Unix/NeXT machines, and it
required the use of the low level &quot;curses&quot; commands for all screen
manipulation and keypress interaction. Each release had to be ported from
scratch to any new platforms, normally by creating visual display code that
acted as a &quot;curses&quot; emulator. One such port was &quot;Macintosh Angband 2.6.1&quot;,
by Keith Randall, which added support for color, and which formed the basis
for the first release of Angband 2.7.0.</p>
<p>During the last half of 1994, Ben Harrison had been playing with the
Angband source, primarily to investigate the possibility of making some
kind of automatic player for Angband, like the old &quot;rogue-o-matic&quot; program
for the game &quot;Rogue&quot;. The difficulty of compiling a version for the
Macintosh, and the complexity of the code, prevented this, and so Ben began
cleaning up the code in various ways for his personal use.</p>
<p>In late 1994, Charles Swiger announced that he was starting a real job and
would no longer be able to be the Angband maintainer. This induced some
amount of uproar in the Angband community (as represented by the Angband
newsgroup), with various people attempting to form &quot;committees&quot; to take
over the maintenance of Angband. Since committees have never given us
anything but trouble (think &quot;COBOL&quot;), there was very little resistance
when, on the first day of 1995, Ben made his code available, calling it
&quot;Angband 2.7.0&quot;, and by default, taking over as the new maintainer of
Angband.</p>
<p>Angband 2.7.0 was a very clean (but very buggy) rewrite that, among other
things, allowed extremely simple porting to multiple platforms, starting
with Unix and Macintosh, and by the time most of the bugs were cleaned up,
in Angband 2.7.2, including X11, and various IBM machines. Angband 2.7.4
was released to the &quot;ftp.cis.ksu.edu&quot; site, and quickly gained acceptance,
perhaps helped by the OS2 and Windows and Amiga and Linux ports. Angband
2.7.5 and 2.7.6 added important capabilities such as macros and user pref
files, and continued to clean up the source. Angband 2.7.8 was released to
the major ftp archives as the first &quot;stable&quot; version in a year or so, with
new &quot;help files&quot; and &quot;spoiler files&quot; for the &quot;online help&quot;, plus a variety
of minor tweaks and some new features.</p>
<p>After Angband 2.7.8 was released, Ben created a web site to keep track of
all the changes made in each version (though a few may have been missed),
and acquired the use of a new development ftp server to supplement the
official &quot;mirror&quot; server. This web site is now permanently located at the
Official Angband Home Page (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thangorodrim.net/">http://www.thangorodrim.net/</a>). Unfortunately,
the next six versions were numbered Angband 2.7.9v1 to Angband 2.7.9v6, but
really each were rather major updates. Angband 2.8.0 and 2.8.1 were
released using a more normal version scheme. Angband 2.8.2 and 2.8.3 add a
few random features, clean up some code, and provide graphics support and
such for a few more platforms.</p>
<p>After the release of Angband 2.8.3 Ben's free time was more and more
occupied by his work. He released a beta version of Angband 2.8.5,
introducing many new features, but couldn't give as much attention to
maintaining the game as he wanted to. Meanwhile, an &quot;unofficial&quot; version by
Robert Ruehlmann, incorporating three popular patches (the &quot;Easy Patch&quot; by
Tim Baker, for opening doors and disarming traps without specifying the
direction: Greg Wooledge's &quot;Random Artifacts&quot; patch: and Keldon Jones's
&quot;Optional Monster AI Improvement&quot;), named &quot;2.8.3h&quot;, was gaining popularity.</p>
<p>So in March 2000, Robert Ruehlmann offered to take over Angband and started
to fix the remaining bugs in the Angband 2.8.5 beta. The resulting version
was to be released as Angband 2.9.0. Further bugfixes and a couple of new
features - including many in the realms of user-customizability, with
greater control over ego-items, player races and classes, monsters, items
and artifacts - have led to the current version.</p>
<p>And with the greater amount of user-customizability that is now possible,
it was inevitable that SOMEBODY would eventually go and actually do
something with it. Jonathan Ellis started customizing the user-editable
text files in the 'edit' directory for his own personal use - originally,
only by fixing bugs and inconsistencies (less powerful monsters being worth
more experience per kill than more powerful ones, dragons doing a decent
amount of damage in melee, monsters with two claws and one mouth getting
one claw and three bite attacks, and so on).</p>
<p>At first, this was all that could really be done with it: adding new
monsters and items was impossible, as the limits were fixed. And so only
three new monsters made an appearance, each of them replacing an existing
monster in the order: and one new artifact - &quot;The Palantir of Westernesse&quot;.
Gameplay balance could be tweaked somewhat, by changing the level, power
and rarity of certain items and monsters: and some changes were made,
mostly with the attempt to reduce the notorious &quot;triple whammy&quot; effect of
needing poison, confusion and nether resistance (or over 550 hps, if
without nether resistance) all at once, straight after passing 2000',
forcing excessive scumming before this depth or risking unavoidable instant
death: and then having nothing left to do but dive straight to 4000' and
scum for speed items, missing out on some of the most interesting depths of
the dungeon. This problem, at least, could be addressed, but actual new
things were less easy to add...</p>
<p>That all changed with Angband 2.9.1, which for the first time moved the
limits themselves to a separate user-editable file, and allowed more
monsters and items to be created without removing the old ones. At the same
time, a patch by Matthias Kurzke was incorporated which allowed the
creation of new ego-items. Various new powers, for the player and monsters,
were added to the game - but no items or monsters yet had these powers
(resist fear, poison brand, lose charisma, summon greater demons, and so
on): indeed, arguably it could be said that the game had not even adjusted
properly to Ben Harrison's fractional speed system (Angband 2.7.0) or the
addition of the other attack forms such as shards, sound, chaos, nexus and
so on (even before Ben.)</p>
<p>The Official Angband Home Page (<a class="reference external" href="http://rephial.org/">http://rephial.org/</a>) serves not only as the
most up to date description of Angband, but also lists changes made between
versions, and changes planned for upcoming versions, and lists various
email addresses and web sites related to Angband.</p>

<div class="section" id="some-of-the-changes-between-angband-2-6-1-and-3-0-6">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id170">3.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and 3.0.6</a></h3>
<p>It is very hard to pin down, along the way from 2.6.2 to 3.0.6, exactly
what changes were made, and exactly when they were made. Most releases
involved so many changes from the previous release as to make &quot;diff files&quot;
not very useful, since often the diff files are as long as the code itself.
Most of the changes, with the notable exception of the creation of some of
the new 'main-xxx.c' files for the various new platforms, and a few other
minor exceptions generally noted directly in comments in the source, were
written by Ben or Robert, either spontaneously, or, more commonly, as the
result of a suggestion or comment by an Angband player.</p>
<p>The most important modification was a massive &quot;code level cleanup&quot; for
2.7.x, largely completed in 2.7.8, that made all other modifications much
simpler and safer. This cleanup was so massive that in many places the code
is no longer recognizable, for example, via &quot;diff -r&quot;, often because it was
rewritten from scratch.</p>
<p>The second most important modification was the design of a generic
'z-term.c' package, which allows Angband to be ported to a new machine
with as few as 50 lines of code. Angband 2.9.3 thus runs without
modification on many machines, including Macintosh, PowerMac, Unix/X11,
Unix/Curses, Amiga, Windows, OS2-386, DOS-386, and even DOS-286.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to list all of the changes between Angband 2.6.1 and
3.0.6, because many of them were made in passing during the massive code
level cleanup. Many of the changes are invisible to the user, but still
provide increased simplicity and efficiency, and decreased code size, or
make other more visable changes possible. For example, the new
'project()' code that handles all bolts, beams, and balls, the new
'update_view()' code that simplifies line of sight computation, or the
new 'generate()' code that builds new levels in the dungeon. Many changes
have been made to increase efficiency, including the new
'process_monsters()' and 'update_monsters()' functions, and the new
'objdes()' and 'light_spot()' routines. The generic 'z-term.c'
package yielded efficient screen updates, and enabled the efficient use of
color.</p>
<p>The most visible (to ordinary players) changes that happened as a result of
Ben Harrison's maintainership were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a far greater degree of user-customizability as shown by the 'info.txt'
files</li>
<li>the &quot;fractional&quot; speed system, with +10 in the new scheme equalling +1
in old money</li>
<li>object stacking, the ability to have more than one object in a square:
first tried in 2.7.9, completed in 2.8.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also be pointed out at this point that the far cleaner nature of
Ben's code as compared to previous versions has given many other people the
opportunity to base code for their own Angband variants on it. And so a
plethora of new variants have appeared, many of them far more different
from Angband now than Angband ever was from Moria, and yet still based on
Ben's coding ideals for Angband.</p>
<p>For Angband 2.9.0, the first few new visible features were a random
artifact generator (originally developed from a variant by Greg Wooledge),
an option to improve monster AI (believed to have originally started out
life in a patch written by Keldon Jones), and a patch to allow easier
handling of opening and closing doors and disarming traps (by Tim Baker).
For Angband 2.9.1 has also come such things as the ability to increase the
size of the editable text files and thus the number of monsters, artifacts,
items, ego-items and vaults in the game (many new vaults were written by
Chris Weisiger, some by others, and the number of vaults in the game at
this time was doubled), and much greater customizability of ego-items has
become possible thanks to a patch written by Matthias Kurzke. It is also
now possible to add new character races to the game, and to edit the
shopkeepers with respect to their greed, tolerance of haggling and
reactions to the character based on his race. Angband 2.9.2 adds support
for poison branded weapons to the game. Angband 2.9.3 made the character
class itself customizable to an extent.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">From: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:koeneke&#64;ionet.net">koeneke&#64;ionet.net</a> (Robert Alan Koeneke)</div>
<div class="line">Newsgroups: rec.games.roguelike.angband,rec.games.roguelike.moria</div>
<div class="line">Subject: Early history of Moria</div>
<div class="line">Date: Wed, 21 Feb 1996 04:20:51 GMT</div>
</div>
<p>I had some email show up asking about the origin of Moria, and its
relation to Rogue. So I thought I would just post some text on the early
days of Moria.</p>
<p>First of all, yes, I really am the Robert Koeneke who wrote the first
Moria. I had a lot of mail accussing me of pulling their leg and such. I
just recently connected to Internet (yes, I work for a company in the
dark ages where Internet is concerned) and was real surprised to find
Moria in the news groups... Angband was an even bigger surprise, since I
have never seen it. I probably spoke to its originator though... I have
given permission to lots of people through the years to enhance, modify,
or whatever as long as they freely distributed the results. I have always
been a proponent of sharing games, not selling them.</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>Around 1980 or 81 I was enrolled in engineering courses at the University
of Oklahoma. The engineering lab ran on a PDP 1170 under an early version
of UNIX. I was always good at computers, so it was natural for me to get
to know the system administrators. They invited me one night to stay and
play some games, an early startrek game, The Colossal Cave Adventure
(later just 'Adventure'), and late one night, a new dungeon game called
'Rogue'.</p>
<p>So yes, I was exposed to Rogue before Moria was even a gleam in my eye.
In fact, Rogue was directly responsible for millions of hours of play
time wasted on Moria and its descendents...</p>
<p>Soon after playing Rogue (and man, was I HOOKED), I got a job in a
different department as a student assistant in computers. I worked on one
of the early VAX 11/780's running VMS, and no games were available for it
at that time. The engineering lab got a real geek of an administrator who
thought the only purpose of a computer was WORK! Imagine... Soooo, no
more games, and no more rogue!</p>
<p>This was intolerable! So I decided to write my own rogue game, Moria Beta
1.0. I had three languages available on my VMS system. Fortran IV, PASCAL
V1.?, and BASIC. Since most of the game was string manipulation, I wrote
the first attempt at Moria in VMS BASIC, and it looked a LOT like Rogue,
at least what I could remember of it. Then I began getting ideas of how
to improve it, how it should work differently, and I pretty much didn't
touch it for about a year.</p>
<p>Around 1983, two things happened that caused Moria to be born in its
recognizable form. I was engaged to be married, and the only cure for
THAT is to work so hard you can't think about it; and I was enrolled for
fall to take an operating systems class in PASCAL.</p>
<p>So, I investigated the new version of VMS PASCAL and found out it had a
new feature. Variable length strings! Wow...</p>
<p>That summer I finished Moria 1.0 in VMS PASCAL. I learned more about data
structures, optimization, and just plain programming that summer then in
all of my years in school. I soon drew a crowd of devoted Moria
players... All at OU.</p>
<p>I asked Jimmey Todd, a good friend of mine, to write a better character
generator for the game, and so the skills and history were born. Jimmey
helped out on many of the functions in the game as well. This would have
been about Moria 2.0</p>
<p>In the following two years, I listened a lot to my players and kept
making enhancements to the game to fix problems, to challenge them, and
to keep them going. If anyone managed to win, I immediately found out
how, and 'enhanced' the game to make it harder. I once vowed it was
'unbeatable', and a week later a friend of mine beat it! His character,
'Iggy', was placed into the game as 'The Evil Iggy', and immortalized...
And of course, I went in and plugged up the trick he used to win...</p>
<p>Around 1985 I started sending out source to other universities. Just
before a OU / Texas football clash, I was asked to send a copy to the
Univeristy of Texas... I couldn't resist... I modified it so that the
begger on the town level was 'An OU football fan' and they moved at
maximum rate. They also multiplied at maximum rate... So the first step
you took and woke one up, it crossed the floor increasing to hundreds of
them and pounded you into oblivion... I soon received a call and provided
instructions on how to 'de-enhance' the game!</p>
<p>Around 1986 - 87 I released Moria 4.7, my last official release. I was
working on a Moria 5.0 when I left OU to go to work for American Airlines
(and yes, I still work there). Moria 5.0 was a complete rewrite, and
contained many neat enhancements, features, you name it. It had water,
streams, lakes, pools, with water monsters. It had 'mysterious orbs'
which could be carried like torches for light but also gave off magical
aura's (like protection from fire, or aggravate monster...). It had new
weapons and treasures... I left it with the student assistants at OU to be
finished, but I guess it soon died on the vine. As far as I know, that
source was lost...</p>
<p>I gave permission to anyone who asked to work on the game. Several people
asked if they could convert it to 'C', and I said fine as long as a
complete credit history was maintained, and that it could NEVER be sold,
only given. So I guess one or more of them succeeded in their efforts to
rewrite it in 'C'.</p>
<p>I have since received thousands of letters from all over the world from
players telling about their exploits, and from administrators cursing the
day I was born... I received mail from behind the iron curtain (while it
was still standing) talking about the game on VAX's (which supposedly
couldn't be there due to export laws). I used to have a map with pins for
every letter I received, but I gave up on that!</p>
<p>I am very happy to learn my creation keeps on going... I plan to download
it and Angband and play them... Maybe something has been added that will
surprise me! That would be nice... I never got to play Moria and be
surprised...</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id180">3.1.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Note from the Maintainer</a></h3>
<p>I have been playing MAngband and TomeNET since 1999, enjoying both of these
multiplayer variants of Angband. Unfortunately, I was frustrated with the
minimal amount of races and classes of MAngband (which is actually a basic
multiplayer variant of Angband), and the overgrowing complexity/sillyness of
TomeNET (which is already based on an Angband variant, ToME).</p>
<p>In 2007, the MAngband community made the MAngband source code easily available
through a svn repository, with a development website allowing to track any
change in the source code. This was the basic framework I was waiting for to
start my own variant. So in April 2007, I started to implement basic features
from TomeNET 3.x into the MAngband code: races, classes, monsters, objects...
(check the whole story here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mangband.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1020">http://www.mangband.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1020</a>).</p>
<p>And finally PWMAngband was born! Since that time, I have continued to implement
new features (and fix bugs...), while adding the new improvements from both
vanilla Angband and MAngband.</p>

<dd>Version 2, June 1991</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<blockquote>
Preamble</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</p>
<p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
<p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.</p>
<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</blockquote>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.</p>
<p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</p>
<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</p>
<p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
<p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</p>
<p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
<p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.</p>
<p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.</p>
<p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.</p>
<p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.</p>
<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>
<p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>
<p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.</p>
<p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
<blockquote>
NO WARRANTY</blockquote>
<p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</blockquote>
<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;</p>
<p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.</p>
<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.</p>
<p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
<blockquote>
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.</blockquote>
<p>The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>
<p>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id184">4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modifying PWMAngband</a></h2>
<p>PWMAngband is not just a great game in its own right, it is really easy to
modify. Much of the detail of the game is contained in text data files. These
can be changed using nothing more than a text editor for an immediate change to
how the game works.</p>
<p>These data files are in lib/gamedata.</p>
<p>Each file has a header which describes the lines which make up entries of the
file, and for the most part this will make it clear what needs to be done to
make changes to the files. Below is brief description of each of the files.</p>
<p>Those who want to change the game more than is allowed just by varying the
data files will need the source code. Below the data file descriptions is a
brief discussion of where to start on such an endeavour.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-data-files">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id185">4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data files</a></h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>constants.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains game values such as carried item capacity, visual range
and dungeon level and town dimensions.</dd>
<dt>object_base.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains the names and common properties of the basic object
classes - scroll, sword, ring, and so on. All objects have an object base.
Each object base is assigned a 'tval' - a numeric index. The tvals are
defined in list-tvals.h. While adding new object bases is possible,
it is unlikely to do much without deeper changes to the game.</dd>
<dt>object.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains the names, properties and description of all the object
types that appear in PWMAngband. New object kinds can easily be added to this
file, or existing ones edited. Each object defined by this file has an
object base, and is also allocated another numeric index called an 'sval'.
A tval-sval pair completely identifies an object - since the tval and sval
are saved to savefiles, removing or adding objects is likely to render
existing save files unusable.</dd>
<dt>ego_item.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains the names, properties and description of ego items, which
are magically enhanced weapons and armour. New ego items can be added or
removed at will, although removing or changing one with an instance currently
in the game might cause problems.</dd>
<dt>artifact.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains the names, properties and description of artifacts, which
are unique items - only one of each will ever be generated. If you are
considering major changes, new artifacts are one of the most visible signs of
a change of theme. Regardless, new artifacts are easy and fun to design.</dd>
<dt>names.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains lists of words which are used to generate names for
random character names, random artifacts and scrolls. Again, in the case
of a change of theme, this is a good way of displaying the new theme.</dd>
<dt>activation.txt</dt>
<dd>Activations are used for artifacts and some regular objects, and could be
used for ego items (see Cloaks of Lordly Resistance). Some standard artifacts
from artifact.txt have activations, and random artifacts may have any
activation from this file chosen for them. Activations can be made up of
any effects (see effects.c and list-effects.h).</dd>
<dt>flavor.txt</dt>
<dd>Items such as potions and wands are assigned a flavor per object kind,
different in each game. There need to be at least as many flavors for each
flavored object base as objects with that base.</dd>
<dt>monster_base.txt</dt>
<dd>Monster bases are the monster equivalent of object bases - classes of monster
like orc, troll or vampire. This file contains the properties common across
all monsters in each of these classes.</dd>
<dt>monster.txt</dt>
<dd>This contains the detail of all monster races, each of which will have its
monster base properties plus additional ones. Some monsters are unique, and
once killed will never reappear.</dd>
<dt>monster_spell.txt</dt>
<dd>All the spells that can be cast by monsters (and are referred to in the
'spells:' lines in monster.txt) are defined in this file. As with
activations, monster spells are built up from effects.</dd>
<dt>pain.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains the various messages that are given to describe how a
monster responds to attack.</dd>
<dt>pit.txt</dt>
<dd>Dungeon levels can contain pits - rooms full of a particular selection of
monsters. This file defines these selections. They can also be used, for
example, to generate partial or complete dungeon levels with themed monsters.</dd>
<dt>class.txt</dt>
<dd>This file completely defines how player classes work, including all details
of castable spells. There are some class-specific properties hard-coded,
which are referred to via the 'flags:' lines, and appear in
list-player-flags.h.</dd>
<dt>p_race.txt</dt>
<dd>This file defines all player race characteristics. Race-specific code is
handled as for classes.</dd>
<dt>body.txt</dt>
<dd>Every player race has a body, which defines what equipment they can use.
Currently there is only one body, which all races use, but this is easily
changeable for significant effect.</dd>
<dt>history.txt</dt>
<dd>This file is for creating the player background found on the character
screen. If a new race is introduced, a selection of background information
for it will need to be added.</dd>
<dt>hints.txt</dt>
<dd>This is simply a list of general pieces of advice that shopkeepers will give
to their customers.</dd>
<dt>quest.txt</dt>
<dd>This file defines the quest monsters (Sauron and Morgoth) and where they
appear. This currently can't easily be changed, as there are still
hard-coded aspects of the quests.</dd>
<dt>terrain.txt</dt>
<dd>This file defines the kind of terrain which can appear in PWMAngband, and its
properties. Current terrain can be changed (with possibly large effects),
but removing it without code changes is likely to break the game. Adding
new terrain will have no effect by itself, because there is no mechanism
for it to appear.</dd>
<dt>trap.txt</dt>
<dd>This defines all traps, door locks and runes. Actual trap effects appear in
effects.c and list-effects.h.</dd>
<dt>room_template.txt</dt>
<dd>This is a list of templates for interesting-shaped rooms which appear in the
dungeon. These can easily be changed and new ones added.</dd>
<dt>vault.txt</dt>
<dd>Similar to room_template.txt, this handles vaults, which are very dangerous
and lucrative rooms.</dd>
<dt>dungeon_profile.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains fairly technical details about the different types of
dungeon level which can be generated. The actual generation routines are in
gen-cave.c; the information here consists of parameters for generating
individual levels, and for how often given level types appear.</dd>
<dt>store.txt</dt>
<dd>This details the shop owners and their relative generosity.</dd>
<dt>blow_effects.txt</dt>
<dd>This defines effects to the player caused by monster attacks. The simplest
monster attacks just deal damage, but others can affect the player's status,
stats or inventory.</dd>
<dt>blow_methods.txt</dt>
<dd>This details the different ways monsters can attack (hit, claw, etc.). It
affects the messages the player gets, and also whether the blow can stun
or cut the player.</dd>
<dt>brand.txt</dt>
<dd>This details how weapon brands work.</dd>
<dt>slay.txt</dt>
<dd>This details how weapons can be more effective against certain monsters.</dd>
<dt>curse.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains all the different curses that can be applied to objects.
It includes what type of object they can be applied to, random effects they
can cause, and how they change an object's properties.</dd>
<dt>object_property.txt</dt>
<dd>This file gives details about what properties an object can have (apart from
basic combat and armor class). Every property has a code which is used
in the game to refer to that property in some way. This means it is not
possible to add new properties to this file and expect to have any effect,
but it is possible to change how existing properties work.</dd>
<dt>object_power.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains formulas for calculating power of objects (used in
determining prices and generating random artifacts). You should only change
this file if you understand the way they are used (defined in
src/obj-power.c).</dd>
<dt>player_timed.txt</dt>
<dd>This file defines some of the properties of timed effects (such as haste and
confusion) that can apply to the player. It chiefly contains the messages
on changes in these effects, and player attributes which prevent the effects.
To add new timed effects or change the way existing ones operate, you will
have to alter src/list-player-timed.h and probably other files, and
re-compile the game.</dd>
<dt>projection.txt</dt>
<dd>This file contains a lot of the defining information about projections -
effects which can be produced at a distance by player or monsters, and
affecting player, monsters, objects, and/or terrain. In particular, this
file defines details of the effects of elemental attacks (such as fire or
shards) and the effectiveness of corresponding player resistance. New
projections have to be included in src/list-projections.h, and the code to
implement their effects put in other source files - src/project-obj.c for
effects on objects, and other similarly-named files.</dd>
<dt>realm.txt</dt>
<dd>This contains a small amount of information about the current magic realms.</dd>
<dt>summon.txt</dt>

<div class="section" id="making-graphical-tilesets">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id186">4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making Graphical Tilesets</a></h3>
<p>You can make new graphical tilesets for PWMAngband or customize existing ones.
In this section we'll dive into how tilesets are defined and describe how to set
one up from scratch. First, we'll enumerate the steps required and then we'll
break down each step in detail.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a directory to contain the tileset's files: (ex. &quot;lib/tiles/foo&quot;)</li>
<li>Register the tileset in &quot;lib/tiles/list.txt&quot;</li>
<li>Create an empty bitmap image large enough to hold your tileset</li>
<li>Store the empty bitmap image in your tileset folder</li>
<li>Author &quot;.prf&quot; files to inform PWMAngband how to use your tileset</li>
</ol>
<p>First you need to create a directory to contain your tileset's files. Put the
directory in lib/tiles and choose a name for the directory that is lower-case
and generally matches the naming convention of the other tilesets you see
there. Once the directory has been created, the next step is to decide how big
the tiles will be in pixels and then create a blank PNG image large enough to
hold all of the tiles (be sure to enable alpha transparency). As an example,
Shockbolt's tileset uses 64x64 pixel tiles. It also uses the special alpha
blending flag so it can use double-height tiles (64x128) for large or tall
monsters. Its dimensions are 8192x2048 but the tileset is not completely
full. More tiles can be added without increasing the size of the image as new
objects are added to future releases of PWMAngband. This should be kept in mind
as packing your tileset into the smallest possible image size may not be the
most maintainable solution. Be sure to name the image file after the tile size,
for example 64x64.png. Use the base size even if you are enabling double-height
tiles.</p>
<p>The only file you'll need to edit outside of your tileset's directory is
lib/tiles/list.txt. list.txt contains a registry of which tilesets to load as
well as some information about the size of the tiles and any special flags to
set. The format of the file is documented in list.txt's header. Specifically,
You will be defining the name of the tileset, which directory contains the
tileset's files, how big the tiles are in pixels (i.e. 64x64), the name of the
main preference file for the tileset and some additional flags which have to do
with alpha blending. Not all tilesets need to set extra flags.</p>
<p>Now that the basic setup is complete you need to tell PWMAngband how to
interpret your tileset image. You need to map each tile in your image to a
specific element in the game so that PWMAngband knows which tiles to show for
which ASCII characters. This process can be done incrementally because
PWMAngband will continue to show the default character symbols in-game for
objects that have not yet been mapped. This is especially helpful for verifying
that your tileset has been setup correctly before beginning to map things out in
earnest. It also means that if new objects are added to the game that you have
not mapped into your tileset, the game will still be playable with your tileset,
albeit the displayed ASCII character may appear incongruous with your styling.
Mapping tiles to game elements is done in text files called preference files
which have the extension '.prf'.</p>
<p>The first thing to understand about mapping game elements in preference files
is that everything that can be displayed in the game has a name, or in the case
of flavors, an ID number. The names for each type of thing can be referenced
from the data files as mentioned above. The table below is a quick reference
for where to find names of things and how to form IDs correctly to reference
them.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>

</table>
<p>Player pictures are referenced differently than other types of objects. They
use a special query syntax that checks to see what kind class the player is as
well as the gender in order to determine which picture to show. The query to
select which tile to show for a female elf ranger would be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
?:[AND [EQU $CLASS Ranger] [EQU $RACE Elf]  [EQU $GENDER Female] ]
</pre>
<p>Here, the query is checking to see if the player is a female Half-Elf and would
use the assignment on the next line of the preference file only if this is
true.</p>
<p>Some types of objects such as terrain can use different tiles based on their
state. In the case of terrain, the terrain can have different images for when
it is lit by a torch, or dark. these are selected by appending another colon
and a specifier to the name. For example, this would be the name of a torch-lit
up staircase:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
feat:up staircase:torch
</pre>
<p>It is possible to specify the same tile be used for all possible states of a
terrain feature by using an asterisk. This example identifies any unknown
terrain tile (a tile the player hasn't lit or otherwise seen yet):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
feat:unknown grid:*
</pre>
<p>Given the full name of an object the last thing to do is to specify which tile
from the tileset to use. Tile locations are given in a coordinate system using
pairs of hexadecimal numbers. The coordinates start from 0x80:0x80 and
increment from there. The pairs translate directly to the top and left most
pixel of the corresponding tile from the graphics file, so the top left pixel
of the first tile on the top left of the graphics file would be specified as
0x80:0x80 (the pixel at x:0 y:0). The next tile immediately to the right of the
that one would be 0x80:0x81. The tilesheet is sliced into rows and columns
based on the tile size you specified in list.txt. So given a tile size of 64x64
pixels, the tile at 0x80:0x81 would be located in the graphics file at pixel
x:64 y:0. Remember, the coordinates in the preference files are in hexadecimal,
so the next number after 0x89 would be 0x8A. The next number after 0x8F would
be 0x90 and so on. To map an object to your tileset you will add one complete
line to the file per object. This example maps the tile at 0x81:0x81 to the
terrain feature 'quartz vein' when the quartz vein is lit by torch light:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
feat:closed door:quartz vein:torch:0x81:0x81
</pre>
<p>Before going any further, it is advisable to map a single object in your
preference file, then start the game up, select your tileset and make sure you
see your mapped tile in game. If this worked, then you are ready to design and
map the rest of your tiles. A quick example would be to map a tile for your
home in the town to the first tile position in your graphics file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
feat:Home:*:0x80:0x80
</pre>
<p>It's possible to have more than one preference file by using a sort of include
syntax that causes other preference files referenced from your main preference
file to also be read. It is also possible to place comments in your preference
files to help you keep track of where different kinds of objects are
mapped. Any text on a line after a '#' symbol is ignored. Shockbolt's tiles
make great use of this and define a well organized set of mappings using three
files with comments for each logical section of objects to be mapped:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# This is a comment
%:other-stuff.prf  # Load another preference file
</pre>
<p>Once you have a working tileset and functional understanding of how tilesets
are managed and organized, it would be a good idea to study Shockbolt's tileset
and follow the examples there in order to produce a high-quality tileset that
you will be proud to share with others.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id197">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How It Works</a></h2>
<p>This document describes how PWMAngband actually <em>works</em> at a high level.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-game">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id198">4.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Game</a></h3>
<p>As you probably know if you're reading this, PWMAngband is a roguelike game set
in a high-fantasy universe. The game world is made up of levels, numbered from
zero (&quot;the town&quot;) to some maximum depth. Levels are increasingly dangerous the
deeper they are into the dungeon. Levels are filled with monsters, traps, and
objects. Monsters move and act on their own, traps react to creatures entering
their square, and objects are inert unless used by a creature. The objective of
the game is to find Morgoth at depth 100 and kill him.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data-structures">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id199">4.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data Structures</a></h3>
<p>There are three important top-level data structures in PWMAngband: the 'chunk',
the player, and the static data tables.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-chunk">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id200">4.3.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chunk</a></h4>
<p>A chunk represents an area of dungeon, and contains everything inside it; this
includes any monsters, objects, or traps inside the bounds of that chunk. A
chunk also keeps a map of the terrain in its area. For unpleasant historical
reasons, all monsters/objects/traps in a chunk are stored in arrays and usually
referred to by index; each square of a chunk knows the indexes (if any) of
monsters/objects/traps contained in it. A chunk also stores AI pathfinding data
for its contained area. All data in the 'current' chunk is lost when leaving the
level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-player">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id201">4.3.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Player</a></h4>
<p>The player is a global object containing information about, well, the player.
All the information in the player is level-independent. This structure contains
stats, any current effects, hunger status, sex/race/class, the player's
inventory, and a grab-bag of other information. Although there is a global
player object, many functions instead take a player object explicitly to make
them easier to test.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-static-data">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id202">4.3.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Static Data</a></h4>
<p>PWMAngband's static data - player and monster races, object types, artifacts, et
cetera - is loaded from the <a class="reference internal" href="#gamedata-files">gamedata Files</a>. Once loaded, this
data is stored in global tables, sometimes referred to as the 'info arrays'.
These arrays are generally declared in the header files of the code that uses
them most, but they are mostly initialized by the edit-file code. The sizes of
these arrays are stored in a 'maxima' structure, called z_info.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-z-layer">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id203">4.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Z Layer</a></h3>
<p>The lowest-level code in PWMAngband is the &quot;Z&quot; layer, which provides
platform-independent abstractions and generic data structures. Currently, the Z
layer provides:</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id204">4.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key Abstractions</a></h3>
<p>Certain game-specific abstractions are important and widely used in PWMAngband
to glue the UI code to the game engine. These are the command queue, which sends
player commands to the game engine, and events, which indicate to the UI that
the state of the game changed.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-command-queue">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id205">4.3.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The command queue</a></h4>
<p>TBD</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="files">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id206">4.3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Files</a></h3>
<p>PWMAngband uses three types of files for storing data: gamedata files, which
contain the game's static data, pref files, which contain UI settings,
and save files, which contain the state of a game in progress.</p>
<div class="section" id="gamedata-files">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id207">4.3.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gamedata Files</a></h4>
<p>Gamedata files use a line-oriented format where fields are separated by colons.
The parser for this format is in &quot;parser.h&quot;. These files are mostly loaded at
initialization time (see <a class="reference internal" href="#init-c-init-angband">init.c - init_angband</a>) and used to fill in the
static data arrays (see <a class="reference internal" href="#the-static-data">The Static Data</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pref-files">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id208">4.3.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pref Files</a></h4>
<p>TBD</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="savefiles">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id209">4.3.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Savefiles</a></h4>
<p>Currently, a savefile is a series of concatenated blocks. Each block has a name
describing what type it is and a version tag. The version tag allows for old
savefiles to be loaded, although the load/save code will only write new
savefiles. Numbers in savefiles are stored in little-endian byte order and
strings are stored null-terminated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-flow">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id210">4.3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control Flow</a></h3>
<p>The flow of control through PWMAngband is complicated and can be very
non-obvious due to overuse of global variables as special-behavior hooks. That
said, this section gives a high-level overview of the control flow of a game
session.</p>
<div class="section" id="startup">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id211">4.3.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startup</a></h4>
<p>Execution begins in main.c, which runs frontend-independent initialization code,
then continues in the appropriate &quot;main-xxx.c&quot; file for the current frontend.
After the game engine is initialized, the player is loaded (or generated) and
gameplay begins.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-c-and-main-xxx-c">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id212">4.3.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;main.c&quot; and &quot;main-xxx.c&quot;</a></h4>
<p>main.c's &quot;main()&quot; is the entry point for PWMAngband execution except on
Windows, where main-win.c's &quot;WinMain()&quot; is used, and on Nintendo DS, where a
special &quot;main()&quot; in main-nds.c is used. The &quot;main()&quot; function is responsible
for dropping permissions if PWMAngband is running setuid, parsing command line
arguments, then finding a frontend to use and initializing it. Once &quot;main()&quot;
finds a frontend, it sets up signal handlers, sets up the display, then calls
&quot;play_game()&quot;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dungeon-c-play-game">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id213">4.3.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dungeon.c - play_game</a></h4>
<p>This function is responsible for driving the remaining initialization. It first
calls <a class="reference internal" href="#init-c-init-angband">init.c - init_angband</a>, which loads all the <a class="reference internal" href="#gamedata-files">gamedata files</a> and
initializes other static data used by the game. It then configures subwindows,
loads a saved game if there is a valid save (see <a class="reference internal" href="#savefiles">savefiles</a>), sets up the RNG,
loads pref files (see <a class="reference internal" href="#prefs-c-process-pref-file">prefs.c - process_pref_file</a>), and enters the game main
loop (see <a class="reference internal" href="#dungeon-c-the-game-main-loop">dungeon.c - the game main loop</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="init-c-init-angband">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id214">4.3.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;init.c - init_angband</a></h4>
<p>The init_angband() function in init.c is responsible for loading and setting up
static data needed by the game engine. Inside init.c, there is a list of 'init
modules' that have startup-time static data they need to initialize, these are
registered in an array of module pointers in init.c, and init_angband() calls
their initialization hooks before doing any other work. The init_angband()
function then loads the top-level pref file (see <a class="reference internal" href="#pref-files">pref files</a>), initializes the
command queue (see <a class="reference internal" href="#the-command-queue">the command queue</a>), then waits for the UI to enqueue
either QUIT, NEWGAME, or LOADFILE. This function returns true if the player
wants to roll a new character, and false if they want to load an existing
character.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prefs-c-process-pref-file">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id215">4.3.6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prefs.c - process_pref_file</a></h4>
<p>The process_pref_file() function in prefs.c is responsible for loading user pref
files, which can live at multiple paths. User preference files override default
preference files. See <a class="reference internal" href="#pref-files">pref files</a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gameplay">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id216">4.3.6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gameplay</a></h4>
<p>Once the simulation is set up, the game main loop in <a class="reference internal" href="#dungeon-c-play-game">dungeon.c - play_game</a> is
responsible for stepping the simulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dungeon-c-the-game-main-loop">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id217">4.3.6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dungeon.c - the game main loop</a></h4>
<p>The main loop of the game is inside play_game() in typical understated
PWMAngband style. This loop runs once per time that either the level is
regenerated, the player dies, or the player quits the game. Each iteration
through, the this loop runs the level main loop to completion for an individual
level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dungeon-c-the-level-main-loop">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id218">4.3.6.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dungeon.c - the level main loop</a></h4>
<p>The main loop for the level is implemented in dungeon() in dungeon.c. The
dungeon() function is called when the player enters a level, and returns only
when the player exits the level, either by changing levels, dying, or quitting.
This function is responsible for tracking the player's max level/depth,
autosaving at level entry, and running the main simulation loop. Each iteration
of the main simulation loop is one &quot;turn&quot; in PWMAngband parlance, or one step of
the simulator. During each turn:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All monsters with more energy than the player act</li>
<li>The player acts</li>
<li>All other monsters act</li>
<li>The UI updates</li>
<li>The world acts</li>
<li>End-of-turn housekeeping is done</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mon-melee2-c-process-monsters">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id219">4.3.6.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mon-melee2.c - process_monsters()</a></h4>
<p>In PWMAngband, creatures act in order of &quot;energy&quot;, which roughly determines how
many actions they can take per step through the simulation. The
process_monsters() function in mon-melee2.c is responsible for walking through
the list of all monsters in the current chunk (see <a class="reference internal" href="#the-chunk">the chunk</a>) and having each
monster act by calling process_monster(), which implements the highest level AI
for monsters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dungeon-c-process-player">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id220">4.3.6.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dungeon.c - process_player()</a></h4>
<p>The process_player() function allows the player to act repeatedly until they do
something that uses energy. Commands like looking around or inscribing items do
not use energy; movement, attacking, casting spells, using items, and so on do.
The rule of thumb is that a command that does not alter game engine state does
not use energy, because it does not represent an action the character in the
simulation is doing. The guts of the process_player() function are actually
handled by process_command() in cmd-core.c, which looks up commands in the
game_cmds table in that file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="keeping-the-ui-up-to-date">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id221">4.3.6.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping the UI up to date</a></h4>
<p>Four related horribly-named functions in player-calcs.h are responsible for
keeping the UI in sync with the simulated character's state:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="23%" />
<col width="77%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>&quot;notice_stuff()&quot;</td>
<td>which deals with pack combining and dropping ignored items;</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>&quot;update_stuff()&quot;</td>
<td><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>which recalculates derived bonuses, AI data, vision, seen</dt>
<dd>monsters, and other things based on the flags in
&quot;player-&gt;upkeep-&gt;update&quot;;</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>&quot;redraw_stuff()&quot;</td>
<td><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>which signals the UI to redraw changed sections of the</dt>
<dd>game state;</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>&quot;handle_stuff()&quot;</td>
<td>which calls update_stuff() and redraw_stuff() if needed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These functions are called during every game loop, after the player and all
monsters have acted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dungeon-c-process-world">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id222">4.3.6.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dungeon.c - process_world()</a></h4>
<p>The process_world() function only runs every 10 turns. It is responsible for the
day/night transition in town, restocking the stores, generating new creatures
over time, dealing poison/cut damage, applying hunger, regeneration, ticking
down timed effects, consuming light fuel, and applying a litany of spell effects
that happen 'at random' from the player's point of view.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>ignore colons (&quot;|&quot;)</li>
<li>ignore paragraphs starting with &quot;..&quot; (including their trailing blank
line)</li>
<li>recognize link targets (&quot;.. _something&quot;) and be
able to open a file to the right position using them.</li>
<li>recognize &quot;menu&quot; links for the online help navigation. Links are given
with the following format (&quot;g&quot; is the hotkey here):</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="tricks">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id228">4.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricks</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes it is tricky to get a thing to display in the correct way in both
the online help and the compiled RST. This is often due to the complex
interaction between backslashes and backticks in RST. In particular, in
several places we need to use in RST a syntax such as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
``D``\isarm
</pre>
<p>If this appeared directly in the help file, then the online help parser
would display a spurious backslash character &quot;&quot; before the &quot;i&quot; letter.
It would be quite complicated to instruct it to parse backslashes using the
full RST syntax. Instead, we adopt the following workaround: we write</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
this is a paragraph containing the word |``D``isarm| just in the middle
</pre>
<p>and later in the file we define a substitution directive</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. |``D``isarm| replace:: ``D``\isarm
</pre>
<p>Magically this works, since the online help parser <em>skips</em> pipes.</p>
