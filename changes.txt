PWMAngband 1.3.0
================

This new version has a few significant changes ported from the Angband 4.1.3
version:

Classes
- Nature realm relies on harnessing the power of the earth, and is opposite
  to the arcane realm, which uses craft and cunning
- Divine realm uses harmony and light, and is opposite to the shadow realm
  which aligns with darkness, power and sacrifice
- Rangers now use nature magic, like the new Druid class
- Necromancers are the major shadow caster class
- Blackguards are fighters enhanced by shadow magic
- Casters use five books
- Classes no longer have different rates of gaining experience

Game Mechanics
- Mages can drain mana from magic devices
- Rogues can steal from monsters
- Temporary brands and slays (Priests, Paladins, Blackguards)
- Healing of hitpoints every turn for a time (Druids)
- Shield bashes (Warriors, Paladins, Blackguards)
- Decoys which monsters will attack instead of the player (Rangers)
- Blackguards can go into a state of bloodlust which improves their combat at
  a price
- Ringwraiths can inflict the Black Breath
- The Bookseller sells books of all realms

Code Improvements
- Change to mostly using a single grid rather than x and y coordinates in
  much of the code
- More readability of datafiles
- Many fixes to bugs and memory leaks
