PWMAngband 1.6.2
================

This release mainly changes the way race/class presets are handled. Presets are
now loaded from the client instead of being fixed on the server. For this to
work with a large amount of data, the network protocol has been altered so that
the VERIFY packet is sent/received in chunks of 1024 lines of data.

And still many bug fixes and code improvements from Angband 4.2.5...

Note: due to some changes in activation difficulties, savefiles have been made
incompatible with the previous version. Please restart a clean server to play
the new version.
