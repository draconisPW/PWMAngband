================
PWMAngband 1.4.0
================

This new version has a few significant changes ported from the Angband 4.2.0
version:

Monsters
- Ainur: most of these now align with one of the great Valar, and have
  corresponding powers
- Dragons: these have mostly been made stronger and deeper
- Hydras: each hydra type is like the previous type with a new head and
  attack added
- People: the association of some of these with player classes has been
  expanded to include the new classes
- Snakes: some of these are now dangerous
- Spiders: more dangerous and deeper, with unique abilities
- Trees/Ents: these are new, tough to kill enemies
- Wights/Wraiths: wights are all now shallower than wraiths, and the
  Ringwraiths are much deeper

Game Mechanics
- Monster shapechanges
- Variable light and darkness are created by monsters, player gear and player
  spells, and the player has a meter to measure the light level on their
  square
- Monsters can whip or spit on the player from nearby
- Monster groups act more as a group, with leaders and sometimes bodyguards
- Innate spells (e.g. breaths) and cast spells (e.g. bolts) have separate
  frequencies
- Deeper in the dungeon shallow monsters are less likely to appear
- Monsters can teleport to the player
- Spiders can weave webs
- Monsters can have innate darkness around them
- Traps added that trigger on leaving their square
- Monster spells can have different levels depending on monster spell power
- The player now has a hunger meter, and food is more important
- New mode where all races gain experience at the same rate, except for
  humans who are faster, and high-elves who are slower

Code Improvements
- Some font improvements
- An option to start a new game after dying instead of closing the game and
  re-opening
- Many fixes to bugs and memory leaks
