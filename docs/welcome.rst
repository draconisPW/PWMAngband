Welcome to PWMAngband
=====================

PWMAngband is a complex multiplayer dungeon simulation. A player (you!)
creates a character, choosing from a variety of races and classes, and then
plays that character over a period of days, weeks, even months.

The player will begin their adventure on the town level where they may acquire
supplies, weapons, armor, and magical devices by buying from various shop
owners. Then the player can descend into the Pits of Angband, where they will
explore the many levels of the dungeon, gaining experience by killing fierce
creatures, collecting powerful objects and valuable treasure, and returning to
town occasionally to buy supplies. Eventually, as the player grows more
experienced, they may attempt to win the game by defeating Morgoth, the Lord of
Darkness, who resides far below the surface.

PWMAngband is a very complex game, and it may be difficult to grasp everything
at first, especially if you have never played a roguelike game before. A key
resource for PWMAngband players is the forum, where you can ask for help, and
also post compliments, complaints, suggestions, bug reports, and interesting
experiences. Don't be shy!
