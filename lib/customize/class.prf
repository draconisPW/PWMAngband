class:Warrior
help:A Warrior is a hack-and-slash character, who solves most problems
help: by cutting them to pieces, but will occasionally fall back on the help of
help: a magical device. Their prime stats are strength, constitution, and
help: dexterity, and they will strike more blows with melee weapons than any
help: other class. A Warrior will be excellent at fighting, shooting and
help: throwing, but bad at most other skills. A warrior has bad stealth and
help: cannot learn any spells.

class:Mage
help:A Mage must live by their wits. They cannot hope to simply hack their way
help: through the dungeon, and so must therefore use his magic to defeat,
help: deceive, confuse, and escape. A mage is not really complete without an
help: assortment of magical devices to use in addition to his spells. They can
help: master the higher level magical devices far easier than anyone else, and
help: has the excellent saving throws to resist effects of spells cast at him.
help: However, they are incredibly weak, getting few hit dice and suffering strong
help: penalties to strength and constitution. Intelligence is their primary stat
help: and at high levels they can cast many spells without a chance of failure.
help: There is no rule that says a mage cannot become a good fighter, but spells
help: are their true realm and they will get fewer blows with melee weapons than
help: other classes.

class:Druid
help:A Druid is a lover of nature, and at one with the natural world. Druids
help: have control of their environment and direct power over creatures, leading
help: even to the ability to take their forms. Druid skills are moderate, and
help: they have some fighting ability, especially when transformed. A druid will
help: usually seek to shape the flow of events to their purpose rather than
help: using devices or missiles, but at high levels they do gain access to
help: potent nature-based magic. Druids rely on their wisdom, and have good
help: saving throws.

class:Priest
help:A Priest is a character of holy devotion. They explore the dungeon only
help: to destroy the evil that lurks within, and if treasure just happens to
help: fall into their packs, well, so much more to the glory of their temple!
help: Priests receive their spells from a deity, and therefore do not choose
help: which spells they will learn. They are familiar with magical devices,
help: preferring to call them "instruments of God", but are not as good as a
help: mage in their use. Priests have great saving throws, and make passable
help: fighters, better if they can find a blessed weapon. Wisdom is the priest's
help: primary stat and at high enough levels they can cast many prayers without
help: a chance of failure. Priests have poor stealth.

class:Necromancer
help:A Necromancer seeks to master the spirits of sentient creatures, creating
help: servants of their own will. They have chosen a dark and wicked path, and
help: run a continual risk of harm to their own body and mind. Necromancers love
help: shadows and hate light, automatically shrouding themselves in darkness.
help: Their spells require high intelligence, and frequently harm the caster or
help: place them in danger. In return they achieve awesome power at high levels.
help: The ultimate aim of the necromancer is to supplant the Dark Enemy and set
help: up a tyranny in his place.

class:Paladin
help:A Paladin is a warrior/priest. Paladins are very good fighters, second
help: only to the warrior class, but not very good at missile weapons. They
help: receive prayers at a slower pace than the priest, but can use all but the
help: most powerful prayers. A paladin lacks much in the way of abilities.
help: Paladins have poor stealth, perception, searching, and magical device use.
help: They have a decent saving throw due to their divine alliance. Their
help: primary stats are strength and wisdom.

class:Rogue
help:A Rogue is a character that prefers to live by their cunning, but is
help: capable of fighting their way out of a tight spot. The master of traps and
help: locks, to the experienced rogue no device is impossible to overcome. A rogue
help: has a high stealth enabling sneaking around many creatures without
help: having to fight, or sneaking up and get the first blow. They can steal items
help: from monsters, but need to be wary of being caught in the act. Rogues'
help: perception is higher than any other class, and many times they will notice
help: a trap or secret door before having to search. A rogue is better than
help: the more fighting oriented classes with magical devices, but still cannot
help: rely on their performance. Rogues can also learn a few spells, but not the
help: powerful offensive spells mages can use, and there will always be a chance
help: of failure even with the simplest spells. A rogue's primary stats are
help: dexterity and intelligence.

class:Ranger
help:A Ranger is at home in nature, and good at turning the environment to
help: good use. Rangers are good fighters, and one of the best of all the classes
help: with missile weapons, especially bows. The ranger learns chiefly spells of
help: survival and forest craft. A ranger has good stealth, good perception,
help: good searching, a good saving throw, and is good with magical devices.
help: Their primary stats are strength, wisdom and dexterity.

class:Blackguard
help:A Blackguard is a brawler of no principle, who lives for the joy of maiming
help: and killing. Blackguards prefer heavy weapons and shields, and learn a few
help: spells for the purpose of wreaking more destruction. Their lust for blood
help: is legendary, with a blackguard in full cry nigh on impossible to kill.
help: Blackguards scorn skills apart from slaughter, and require strength and
help: intelligence (or rat-cunning) to thrive in the dungeon.

class:Sorceror
help:Sorcerors use intelligence primarily, determining how much mana they have to
help: cast spells and how low their failure rate is. They are the all-around best
help: magicians, having the most powerful spells. A high-level Sorceror can be very
help: powerful, but getting there can be a difficult journey. On the downside, they
help: are the worst fighters, being unable to use any weapon but a Mage Staff
help: comfortably, and still unable to be anything even remotely approaching
help: effective with it. A Sorceror has very few hit points compared to other
help: classes, making survival difficult in the beginning. That's why this class is
help: not recommended for beginners. Intelligence is the sorceror's primary stat.

class:Unbeliever
help:The full opposite of Sorcerors, Unbelievers so strongly despise magic that
help: not only do they refuse to use magic spells, they refuse all training in the
help: use of magic items, which leaves them almost totally incompetent when trying
help: to use a magic item, although they can still quaff potions and read scrolls.
help: Because they are so unattuned to magic, Unbelievers can prevent magical gates
help: from opening around them, eventually extending to a complete suppression of
help: teleportation abilities and all magic in the area around them.

class:Archer
help:Archers aren't good at fighting, but can deliever extremely high damage with
help: their ranged weapons. They can die quickly too, however. Archers are to bows
help: what warriors are to melee. They are the best class around with any
help: bow/xbow/sling. An Archer is very bad at melee, being only better than the
help: Sorceror. Wisdom and Dexterity are the archer's primary stats.

class:Monk
help:Monks are warriors who decide to fight barehanded. As they advance in levels,
help: they gain some new martial arts techniques to hit their opponents more
help: effectively. With levels, they also gain interesting abilities: at level 10,
help: they learn to fall like a feather; at level 15, they become resistant to
help: fear; at level 20, they become resistant to confusion; finally, at level 25,
help: they learn to resist paralysis effects. They can't wield weapons, but get
help: extra damage, defense and attacks per round as they advance in levels.
help: However, they must wear light armor to stay unencumbered and fully benefit
help: from their class bonuses.

class:Telepath
help:Telepaths are mindcrafters who use the powers of their mind to weaken or even
help: kill creatures. They are weak in melee, although they can use weapons just
help: like mages or priests. Wisdom is their primary stat.

class:Elementalist
help:Elementalists are spellcasters specialized in offensive spells. They share
help: the same stats as mages, but get almost no support spells at all. They rely
help: on the powers of the four elements (Air, Fire, Earth, Water) and can combine
help: them to cast powerful Elemental spells. Elementalists have the innate ability
help: to increase the power of their spells by studying them again each time they
help: level. As masters of the elements, they gain intrinsic basic resistances as
help: they level, fire at 10, cold at 15, acid at 20 and lightning at 25.

class:Summoner
help:A Summoner is the weakest of all classes you may choose. They have pathetic
help: stats, no fighting abilities, and little spells to kill enemies with magic.
help: However, all these weaknesses don't trouble them much, because they can
help: summon creatures to help them in battle, and still gain some experience from
help: their kills. Summoners use wisdom to cast spells and summon allies, and to
help: determine how many of them they can control and how effectively they can
help: control them.

class:Shapechanger
help:Shapechangers are fighters that get abilities from the forms they can mimic.
help: Basically, Shapechangers will melee a lot with the benefits from their
help: current form (resists, melee brands, defense, speed and damage boosts...).
help: Some of those forms will provide innate spells and even breath attacks.
help: Shapechangers get basic mana points to cast those spells (note that breath
help: attacks, like for the Dragon race, don't cost mana, but hit points
help: instead...).

class:Villager
help:Villagers are common folks, versatile and able to do anything, but also
help: average at everything they do. They have no strengths nor weaknesses.
help: Villagers use stamina given by their constitution to perform common tasks
help: and can be accompanied by a single pet that they can summon at their leisure.
help: They can chop wood and mine ore more easily as they advance in levels. They
help: are able to turn terrain into crops and farm food from them.
