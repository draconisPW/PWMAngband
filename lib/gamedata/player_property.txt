# Used in conjunction with list-player-flags.h, list-object-flags.h and
# list-elements.h
# Player properties
#
# Descriptions and names can be edited without bad effects.
# Changing the code, or type will severely disrupt the game, and should only
# be done when the associated list-*.h files (and other code) are also
# being changed, and the game recompiled.
# Adding new entries will have no effect without further datafile and code
# changes.
#
# Fields:
# type - the type of player property.  Valid types are
#    player  - special player flag from list-player-flags.h
#    object  - object flag from list-object-flags.h
#    element - resistance, immunity or vulnerability to an element
# code - the property name used by the game. Element codes are templates, and
#        one is made for each element
# name - the name of the property
# desc - the description of the property
# value - value for elements; -1 (vulnerability), 1 (resistance) or 3 (immunity)
