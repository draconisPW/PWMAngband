# Simple role-playing messages.

# N: serial number : action
# I: target: max_dist
# D: description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new action.

# 'I' is for basic information. The target tells if the action
# asks for a target or not. The max_dist tells the maximal
# distance to target (0 to disable).

# 'D' is for description. Each social contains 5 lines of text.
# First 2 lines are for actions without a target:
#   Line 1 specifies what the player sees.
#   Line 2 specifies what others near the player see.
# Next 3 lines are for actions with a target:
#   Line 3 specifies what the player sees.
#   Line 4 specifies what others near the player see.
#   Line 5 specifies what the target sees.
# Lines are formatted, using the following format specifiers:
#   $n = player name
#   $s = possessive, genderized (player)
#   $m = objective (or reflexive), genderized (player)
#   $N = target name
#   $S = possessive, genderized (target)
#   $M = objective (or reflexive), genderized (target)
