# File: swear.txt


# This file is used to initialize the swear words for the game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# That said, it isn't difficult. Just keep each word on one line, less than 80
# characters, and start each line with W:

# === Understanding swear.txt === 

# W : swear word (in lowercase); prefix with @ to check whole word instead of
#     substring


W:@ass
W:fuck
W:shit
