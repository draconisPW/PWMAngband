# feat : symbol : special symbol : terrain type

# 'feat' lines describe the type of terrain. 'Symbol' is the symbol used 
# on the metamap (see town_XXX.txt files). 'Terrain type' is the feature
# used to represent the terrain (see terrain.txt). 'Special symbol' is used
# to distinguish different terrain types that are using the same symbol.
