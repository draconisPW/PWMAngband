Most of your interaction with PWMAngband will take the form of "commands".
Every PWMAngband command consists of an "underlying command" plus a variety of
optional or required arguments, such as a repeat count, a direction, or the
index of an inventory object. Commands are normally specified by typing a
series of keypresses, from which the underlying command is extracted, along
with any encoded arguments. You may choose how the standard "keyboard keys"
are mapped to the "underlying commands" by choosing one of the two standard
"keysets", the "original" keyset or the "roguelike" keyset.

The original keyset is very similar to the "underlying" command set, with a
few additions (such as the ability to use the numeric "directions" to
"walk" or the '5' key to "stay still"). The roguelike keyset provides
similar additions, and also allows the use of the
'h'/'j'/'k'/'l'/'y'/'u'/'b'/'n' keys to "walk" (or, in
combination with the shift or control keys, to run or alter), which thus
requires a variety of key mappings to allow access to the underlying
commands used for walking/running/altering. In particular, the "roguelike"
keyset includes many more "capital" and "control" keys, as shown below.

Note that any keys that are not required for access to the underlying
command set may be used by the user to extend the "keyset" which is being
used, by defining new "keymaps". To avoid the use of any "keymaps", press
backslash ('\\') plus the "underlying command" key. You may enter
"control-keys" as a caret ('^') plus the key (so '^' + 'p' yields
'^p').

Some commands will prompt for extra information, such as a direction, an
inventory or equipment item, a spell, a textual inscription, the symbol of
a monster race, a sub-command, a verification, an amount of time, a
quantity, a file name, or various other things. Normally you can hit return
to choose the "default" response, or escape to cancel the command entirely.

Some commands will prompt for a spell or an inventory item. Pressing space
(or '*') will give you a list of choices. Pressing '-' (minus) selects
the item on the floor. Pressing a lowercase letter selects the given item.
Pressing a capital letter selects the given item after verification.
Pressing a numeric digit '#' selects the first item (if any) whose
inscription contains '@#' or '@x#', where 'x' is the current
"underlying command". You may only specify items which are "legal" for the
command. Whenever an item inscription contains '!*' or '!x' (with 'x'
as above) you must verify its selection.

Some commands will prompt for a direction. You may enter a "compass"
direction using any of the "direction keys" shown below. Sometimes, you may
specify that you wish to use the current "target", by pressing 't' or
'5', or that you wish to select a new target, by pressing '*' (see
"Target" below).

        Original Keyset Directions 
                 =  =  =                           
                 7  8  9
                 4     6
                 1  2  3
                 =  =  =

        Roguelike Keyset Directions
                 =  =  =
                 y  k  u
                 h     l
                 b  j  n
                 =  =  =

Each of the standard keysets provides some short-cuts over the "underlying
commands". For example, both keysets allow you to "walk" by simply pressing
an "original" direction key (or a "roguelike" direction key if you are
using the roguelike keyset), instead of using the "walk" command plus a
direction. The roguelike keyset allows you to "run" or "alter" by simply
holding the shift or control modifier key down while pressing a "roguelike"
direction key, instead of using the "run" or "alter" command plus a
direction. Both keysets allow the use of the '5' key to "stand still",
which is most convenient when using the original keyset.

Note: 'BKS' is equal to the BACKSPACE key.

Special Keys
============
 
Certain special keys may be intercepted by the operating system or the host
machine, causing unexpected results. In general, these special keys are
control keys, and often, you can disable their special effects.
 
It is often possible to specify "control-keys" without actually pressing
the control key, by typing a caret ('^') followed by the key. This is
useful for specifying control-key commands which might be caught by the
operating system as explained above.

Pressing backslash ('\\') before a command will bypass all keymaps, and
the next keypress will be interpreted as an "underlying command" key,
unless it is a caret ('^'), in which case the keypress after that will be
turned into a control-key and interpreted as a command in the underlying
angband keyset. The backslash key is useful for creating actions which are
not affected by any keymap definitions that may be in force, for example,
the sequence '\\' + '.' + '6' will always mean "run east", even if the
'.' key has been mapped to a different underlying command.

The '0' and '^' and '\\' keys all have special meaning when entered at
the command prompt, and there is no "useful" way to specify any of them as
an "underlying command", which is okay, since they would have no effect.

For many input requests or queries, the special character 'ESCAPE' will
abort the command. The '[y/n]' prompts may be answered with 'y' or
'n', or 'escape'.
 
Selection of Objects
====================
 
Many commands will prompt for a particular object to be used.
For example, the command to read a scroll will ask you which of the
scrolls that you are carrying that you wish to read. In such cases, the
selection is made by typing a letter of the alphabet (or a number if choosing
from the quiver). The prompt will indicate the possible letters/numbers,
and you will also be shown a list of the appropriate items. Often you will
be able to press '/' to switch between inventory and equipment, or '|' to
select the quiver, or '-' to select the floor. Using the right arrow also
rotates selection between equipment, inventory, quiver, floor and back to
equipment; the left arrow rotates in the opposite direction.
 
The particular object may be selected by an upper case or a lower case
letter. If lower case is used, the selection takes place immediately. If
upper case is used, then the particular option is described, and you are
given the option of confirming or retracting that choice. Upper case
selection is thus safer, but requires an extra key stroke.

For more information on selecting object, see the file 'customize.txt'.
