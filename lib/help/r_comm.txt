Roguelike Keyset Command Summary
================================

^ followed by a letter is an abbreviation for pressing and releasing
the letter key with the control key also depressed. You may also press
and release ^ and then press and release the letter key to activate the
same command in case your system intercepts the control plus key
combination and does not pass it on.
