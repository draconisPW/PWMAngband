# name: serial number : menu name
# directory: directory name
# size: tile width : tile height : tileset file name
# pref: preference file name
# extra: alphablending : start row : end row of double high tiles : distorted

# 'name' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new item. The menu name is the name of the graphics mode
# listed under when selecting it from a graphical menu.

# 'directory' is for the pathname to the directory storing this mode's files.

# 'size' is for image information - tile width and height are the dimensions,
# in pixels, of an individual tile in the set. "filename" is the name of the
# image file to load.

# 'pref' is for preference file name - the name of the preference file which
# allocates tiles to game items.

# 'extra' is for extra information - alpha is a flag if the tileset needs to use
# alpha blending. Double high tiles are ones that have twice the tile height
# as a typical tile. "start row" is the first row that uses double high tiles.
# "end row" is the last row that uses double high tiles. "start row" and
# "end row" must be greater than 0, if double high tiles are used, and refer
# to the bottom half of the double row.
