/*
 * In this file, we use the SQUARE_WALL flags to the info field in
 * cave->squares. Those are usually only applied and tested on granite, but
 * some (SQUARE_WALL_INNER) is applied and tested on permanent walls.
 * SQUARE_WALL_SOLID indicates the wall should not be tunnelled;
 * SQUARE_WALL_INNER marks an inward-facing wall of a room; SQUARE_WALL_OUTER
 * marks an outer wall of a room.
 *
 * We use SQUARE_WALL_SOLID to prevent multiple corridors from piercing a wall
 * in two adjacent locations, which would be messy, and SQUARE_WALL_OUTER
 * to indicate which walls surround rooms, and may thus be pierced by corridors
 * entering or leaving the room.
 *
 * Note that a tunnel which attempts to leave a room near the edge of the
 * dungeon in a direction toward that edge will cause "silly" wall piercings,
 * but will have no permanently incorrect effects, as long as the tunnel can
 * eventually exit from another side. And note that the wall may not come back
 * into the room by the hole it left through, so it must bend to the left or
 * right and then optionally re-enter the room (at least 2 grids away). This is
 * not a problem since every room that is large enough to block the passage of
 * tunnels is also large enough to allow the tunnel to pierce the room itself
 * several times.
 *
 * Note that no two corridors may enter a room through adjacent grids, they
 * must either share an entryway or else use entryways at least two grids
 * apart. This prevents large (or "silly") doorways.
 *
 * Traditionally, to create rooms in the dungeon, it was divided up into
 * "blocks" of 11x11 grids each, and all rooms were required to occupy a
 * rectangular group of blocks. As long as each room type reserved a
 * sufficient number of blocks, the room building routines would not need to
 * check bounds. Note that in classic generation most of the normal rooms
 * actually only use 23x11 grids, and so reserve 33x11 grids.
 *
 * Note that a lot of the original motivation for the block system was the
 * fact that there was only one size of map available, 22x66 grids, and the
 * dungeon level was divided up into nine of these in three rows of three.
 * Now that the map can be resized and enlarged, and dungeon levels themselves
 * can be different sizes, much of this original motivation has gone. Blocks
 * can still be used, but different cave profiles can set their own block
 * sizes. The classic generation method still uses the traditional blocks; the
 * main motivation for using blocks now is for the aesthetic effect of placing
 * rooms on a grid.

 * - a count is now kept of grids of the various terrains, allowing dungeon

 * - there are three new room types - huge rooms, rooms of chambers
