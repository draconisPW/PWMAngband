 * Projection paths
 */


/*
 * Determine the path taken by a projection.
 *
 * The projection will always start from grid1, and will travel
 * towards grid2, touching one grid per unit of distance along
 * the major axis, and stopping when it enters the finish grid or a
 * wall grid, or has travelled the maximum legal distance of "range".
 *
 * Note that "distance" in this function (as in the "update_view()" code)
 * is defined as "MAX(dy,dx) + MIN(dy,dx)/2", which means that the player
 * actually has an "octagon of projection" not a "circle of projection".
 *
 * The path grids are saved into the grid array pointed to by "gp", and
 * there should be room for at least "range" grids in "gp".  Note that
 * due to the way in which distance is calculated, this function normally
 * uses fewer than "range" grids for the projection path, so the result
 * of this function should never be compared directly to "range".  Note
 * that the initial grid is never saved into the grid array, not
 * even if the initial grid is also the final grid.  XXX XXX XXX
 *
 * The "flg" flags can be used to modify the behavior of this function.
 *
 * In particular, the "PROJECT_STOP" and "PROJECT_THRU" flags have the same
 * semantics as they do for the "project" function, namely, that the path
 * will stop as soon as it hits a monster, or that the path will continue
 * through the finish grid, respectively.
 *
 * The "PROJECT_JUMP" flag, which for the "project()" function means to
 * start at a special grid (which makes no sense in this function), means
 * that the path should be "angled" slightly if needed to avoid any wall
 * grids, allowing the player to "target" any grid which is in "view".
 *
 * This function returns the number of grids (if any) in the path.  This
 * function will return zero if and only if grid1 and grid2 are equal.
 *
 * This algorithm is similar to, but slightly different from, the one used
 * by "update_view_los()", and very different from the one used by "los()".

/*
 * Generic "beam"/"bolt"/"ball" projection routine.
 *
 * origin: Origin of the projection
 * rad: Radius of explosion (0 = beam/bolt, 1 to 20 = ball), or maximum
 *      length of arc from the source.
 * cv: Current cave
 * finish: Target location (or location to travel towards)
 * dam: Base damage to apply to monsters, terrain, objects, or players
 * typ: Type of projection (fire, frost, dispel demons etc.)
 * flg: Extra bit flags that control projection behavior
 * degrees_of_arc: How wide an arc spell is (in degrees).
 * diameter_of_source: how wide the source diameter is.
 * what: message to other players if the target dies
 *
 * Returns true if any effects of the projection were observed, else false
 *
 *
 * At present, there are five major types of projections:
 *
 * Point-effect projection: (no PROJECT_BEAM flag, radius of zero, and either
 *   jumps directly to target or has a single source and target grid)
 * A point-effect projection has no line of projection, and only affects one 
 *   grid. It is used for most area-effect spells (like dispel evil) and
 *   pinpoint strikes like the monster Holding prayer.
 * 
 * Bolt: (no PROJECT_BEAM flag, radius of zero, has to travel from source to
 *   target)
 * A bolt travels from source to target and affects only the final grid in its
 *   projection path. If given the PROJECT_STOP flag, it is stopped by any
 *   monster or character in its path (at present, all bolts use this flag).
 *
 * Beam: (PROJECT_BEAM)
 * A beam travels from source to target, affecting all grids passed through 
 *   with full damage. It is never stopped by monsters in its path. Beams
 *   may never be combined with any other projection type.
 *
 * Ball: (positive radius, unless the PROJECT_ARC flag is set)
 * A ball travels from source towards the target, and always explodes. Unless
 *   specified, it does not affect wall grids, but otherwise affects any grids 
 *   in LOS from the center of the explosion.
 * If used with a direction, a ball will explode on the first occupied grid in 
 *   its path. If given a target, it will explode on that target. If a
 *   wall is in the way, it will explode against the wall. If a ball reaches
 *   z_info->max_range without hitting anything or reaching its target, it will
 *   explode at that point.
 *
 * Arc: (positive radius, with the PROJECT_ARC flag set)
 * An arc is a portion of a source-centered ball that explodes outwards 
 *   towards the target grid. Like a ball, it affects all non-wall grids in
 *   LOS of the source in the explosion area. The width of arc spells is con-
 *   trolled by degrees_of_arc.
 * An arc is created by rejecting all grids that form the endpoints of lines 
 *   whose angular difference (in degrees) from the centerline of the arc is 
 *   greater than one-half the input "degrees_of_arc". See the table "get_
 *   angle_to_grid" in "gen-util.c" for more information.
 * Note: An arc with a value for degrees_of_arc of zero is actually a beam of
 *   defined length.
 *
 * Projections that effect all monsters in LOS are handled through the use 
 *   of the PROJECT_LOS effect, which applies a single-grid projection to
 *   individual monsters. Projections that light up rooms or affect all
 *   monsters on the level are more efficiently handled through special
 *   functions.
 *
 * Variations:
 *
 * PROJECT_STOP forces a path of projection to stop at the first occupied grid 
 *   it hits. This is used with bolts, and also by ball spells travelling in
 *   a specific direction rather than towards a target.
 *
 * PROJECT_THRU allows a path of projection towards a target to continue 
 *   past that target. It also allows a spell to affect wall grids adjacent
 *   to a grid in LOS of the center of the explosion.
 * 
 * PROJECT_JUMP allows a projection to immediately set the source of the pro-
 *   jection to the target. This is used for all area effect spells (like
 *   dispel evil), and can also be used for bombardments.
 * 
 * PROJECT_HIDE erases all graphical effects, making the projection invisible.
 *
 * PROJECT_GRID allows projections to affect terrain features.
 *
 * PROJECT_ITEM allows projections to affect objects on the ground.
 *
 * PROJECT_KILL allows projections to affect monsters.
 *
 * PROJECT_PLAY allows projections to affect the player.
 *
 * degrees_of_arc controls the width of arc spells. With a value for
 *   degrees_of_arc of zero, arcs act like beams of defined length.
 *
 * diameter_of_source controls how quickly explosions lose strength with dis-
 *   tance from the target. Most ball spells have a source diameter of 10,
 *   which means that they do 1/2 damage at range 1, 1/3 damage at range 2, 
 *   and so on. Caster-centered balls usually have a source diameter of 20,
 *   which allows them to do full damage to all adjacent grids. Arcs have
 *   source diameters ranging up from 20, which allows the spell designer to
 *   fine-tune how quickly a breath loses strength outwards from the breather.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *
 * If the source grid is not the same as the target, we project along the path 
 *   between them. Bolts stop if they hit anything, beams stop if they hit a
 *   wall, and balls and arcs may exhibit either bahavior. When they reach
 *   the final grid in the path, balls and arcs explode. We do not allow
 *   beams to be combined with explosions.
 * Balls affect all floor grids in LOS (optionally, also wall grids adjacent 
 *   to a grid in LOS) within their radius. Arcs do the same, but only within
 *   their cone of projection.
 * Because affected grids are only scanned once, and it is really helpful to 
 *   have explosions that travel outwards from the source, they are sorted by 
 *   distance. For each distance, an adjusted damage is calculated.
 * In successive passes, the code then displays explosion graphics, erases 
 *   these graphics, marks terrain for possible later changes, affects 
 *   objects, monsters, the character, and finally changes features and 
 *   teleports monsters and characters in marked grids.
 *
 * Usage and graphics notes:
 *
 * Only 256 grids can be affected per projection, limiting the effective 
 * radius of standard ball attacks to nine units (diameter nineteen). Arcs
 * can have larger radii; an arc capable of going out to range 20 should not 
 * be wider than 70 degrees.
 *
 * Balls must explode BEFORE hitting walls, or they would affect monsters on 
 * both sides of a wall. 
 *
 * Note that for consistency, we pretend that the bolt actually takes time
 * to move from point A to point B, even if the player cannot see part of the
 * projection path. Note that in general, the player will *always* see part
 * of the path, since it either starts at the player or ends on the player.
 *
 * Hack -- we assume that every "projection" is "self-illuminating".
 *
 * Hack -- when only a single monster is affected, we automatically track
 * (and recall) that monster, unless "PROJECT_JUMP" is used.
 *
 * Note that we must call "handle_stuff()" after affecting terrain features
 * in the blast radius, in case the illumination of the grid was changed,
 * and "update_view()" and "update_monsters()" need to be called.
